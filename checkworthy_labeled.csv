16,I think we've seen a deterioration of values.,No
17,I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.,No
18,"For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.",No
19,"So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.",No
20,"We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.",No
21,And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.,No
22,"And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.",No
23,"But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.",No
24,We've got to get after the users more.,No
25,We have to change this whole culture.,No
27,"And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.",No
29,Everybody ought to be in this thing.,No
30,"Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.",No
31,And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.,No
32,But we have got to instill values in these young people.,No
33,And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.,No
34,"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",No
36,I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.,No
37,But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.,No
38,That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.,No
39,Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.,Yes
40,We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.,Yes
41,Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.,No
42,"I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.",No
43,We're providing that young woman with help.,No
44,"But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.",No
45,"Values begin at the top, in the White House.",No
46,Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.,No
50,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.",No
51,And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.,No
52,"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.",No
53,"Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.",Yes
54,But we also have to take demand seriously.,No
55,"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.",Yes
56,We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.,Yes
57,Doing better in the neighborhoods.,No
58,"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",No
60,I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.,No

68,"But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.",No
69,"Values begin at the top, in the White House.",No
70,Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.,No
74,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.",No
75,And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.,No

78,But we also have to take demand seriously.,No
79,"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.",Yes
81,And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.,Yes
82,We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.,No
83,"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.",No
84,"And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.",No
85,"I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.",No
86,"If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.",No
88,"Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.",No
89,I asked for and received the same briefing.,No
90,I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.,No
91,And what I'm about to say is unclassified.,No
92,Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.,Yes
93,It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.,Yes
94,"And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.",Yes
95,And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.,No
96,Panama is a friendly country.,No
97,"I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.",Yes
98,And we want to bring him to justice.,No
99,And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.,No
105,"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.",No
106,"And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.",Yes
107,"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.",No
108,"Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.",No
109,"I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.",No
110,"Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.",No
111,Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.,No
112,"Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.",No
113,"And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.",Yes
114,It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.,No
115,I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.,No
116,"We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.",Yes
117,"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.",No
118,The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.,No
119,"He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.",Yes
120,He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.,No
121,"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.",No
123,But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.,No
124,I will say this -,No
126,"If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.",Yes
128,Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?,No
132,"There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.",No
133,"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.",No
134,John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.,Yes
135,"Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.",Yes
136,It's not going to cost the government money.,No
137,"It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.",No
138,So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.,No
139,"Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.",Yes
140,That happens to be a fact.,Yes
141,"And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.",No
142,"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",No
148,I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.,No
149,"And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.",No
150,"They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.",No
151,"I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.",Yes
152,He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.,No
153,I would like a balanced budget amendment.,No
154,But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.,Yes
155,So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.,No
156,It is that we are continuing to spend too much.,No
157,"So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.",No
158,Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.,No
159,"And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.",Yes
160,And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.,No
161,Spending was only up something like 4 percent.,Yes
162,"So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.",No
163,"And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.",No
164,"And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.",No
165,"Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.",No
166,"A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",No
168,"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.",No
169,"What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.",Yes
170,Why that's more than the average teacher makes.,Yes
171,"We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.",No
173,"It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.",No
179,"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.",No
180,I want to keep this economic recovery going.,No
181,"More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.",Yes
182,What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.,No
183,I believe that's the answer.,No
184,I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.,Yes
185,And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.,No
186,But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.,No
187,"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.",No
188,"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it.""",No
189,And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.,No
190,"All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.",No
191,There isn't any such thing as something free out there.,No
192,It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.,No
193,"So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.",No
194,I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.,No
195,I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.,No
196,It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.,No
197,But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.,No
199,"But, George, that's no answer.",No
200,"You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.",No
201,"Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.",Yes
203,All of them with little or no health insurance.,No
204,One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.,No
205,"Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.",No
206,My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.,Yes
207,"The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.",No
208,And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.,No
209,That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.,No
215,"Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.",No
217,Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.,No
218,"But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.",No
220,It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.,No
221,"Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.",No
226,Let me say this about AIDS.,No
227,"It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.",Yes
229,And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.,No
230,But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.,No
231,"In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.",No
232,The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.,No
233,I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.,No
235,"Well, we're on the right track.",No
236,The NIH is doing a good job in research.,No
237,The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.,No
238,I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.,No
239,But we got to have a knowledge base.,No
240,"Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.",No
241,We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.,No
242,I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.,No
243,"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.",No
244,We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.,No
245,"So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.",No
259,"Well, I don't question his passion.",No
260,I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.,No
261,He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.,Yes
262,"Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.",No
263,He - we have a big difference on issues.,No
264,"You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.",No
265,"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87.",No
266,"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.""",No
267,That was what he said.,No
268,He is out there on out of the mainstream.,No
270,"My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.",No
271,And I wish we had time to let me explain.,No
272,But I salute him for his passion.,No
273,"We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.",No
282,But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.,No
283,"But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.",No
284,"Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.",No
285,"I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.",No
286,But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.,No
287,I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.,No
288,I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.,No
289,I like those ratings systems.,No
290,I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.,No
291,"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency.",No
292,"Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.",No
293,And I don't agree with them.,No
294,"He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.",No
295,I don't agree with that.,No
296,I come from a different point.,No
297,And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.,No
298,They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.,No
299,"You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.",No
300,Governor Thompson of Illinois did.,No
301,I'm not questioning his patriotism.,No
302,He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.,No
303,And then all the liberal columnists join in.,No
305,"I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.",No
306,"But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.",Yes
307,"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.",No
308,And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.,No
310,"Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.",No
311,"Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.",No
312,"I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.",No
314,My parents came to this country as immigrants.,No
315,They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.,No
316,I'm in public service because I love this country.,No
318,And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.,No
319,The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.,No
320,To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.,Yes
322,"Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.",No
323,"When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.",Yes
324,"I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.",No
325,Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.,No
326,"Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.",No
333,I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.,No
334,I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.,No
335,"I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.",No
336,The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.,No
337,"My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.",No
339,"These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.",No
340,The government has a role.,No
341,It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.,No
342,There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.,Yes
343,And so I think that we're on the right track.,No
344,"I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.",No
345,I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.,No
346,"I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.",No
347,They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.,No
348,And we're on the track on this one.,No
349,"But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.",No
350,I'd say around 30 percent.,No
351,And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.,No
352,Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.,No
353,Because there is a major problem there.,No
354,A lot of them are mentally sick.,No
355,And we've got to attend to them.,No
356,"But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",No
358,"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.",Yes
359,"The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.",Yes
360,"And when you do that, you've have homeless families.",No
361,"We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.",Yes
362,We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.,No
363,We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.,No
365,And I think the housing community is ready.,No
366,"But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.",No
367,"And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.",No
368,"We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.",No
369,This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.,No
373,"Well, I certainly hope not.",No
374,And it's all a question of what our priorities are.,No
375,Mr. Bush talked about values.,No
378,"Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?",No
380,"You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.",Yes
381,We went out and built housing.,No
382,The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.,No
383,"Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.",No
385,This is a question of organizing the housing community.,No
386,"I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.",No
387,"Washington, by itself, can't do it all.",No
389,But governors are ready; mayors are ready.,No
390,Builders and community leaders are ready.,No
391,"It will require some funds, John.",No
392,And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.,No
393,"But that, too, will require some choices.",No
394,Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.,No
395,"Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?",No
396,"Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.",No
397,Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.,No
398,"Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.",No
399,"And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.",No
400,"We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.",No
401,It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.,No
403,I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.,No
404,Let's talk about housing which the question was.,No
405,"When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?",No
406,Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.,Yes
407,"Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?",No
409,We are serving a million more families now.,Yes
410,"But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.",No
414,I want to see more vouchers.,No
415,"I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.",No
416,"They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.",Yes
417,"But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.",No
421,"No, I don't think there is.",No
422,"There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.",No
423,I'm opposed to the death penalty.,No
424,I think everybody knows that.,No
425,I'm also very tough on violent crime.,No
426,And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.,Yes
427,It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.,Yes
428,"It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.",No
429,"You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.",Yes
430,"The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.",No
433,I don't think most people do.,No
434,The question is who makes the decision.,No
435,"And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",No
437,"Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.",No
438,It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.,Yes
439,The federal program doesn't do that.,Yes
440,No other state programs do that.,Yes
441,And I favor the death penalty.,No
442,I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.,No
443,"But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.",No
444,And I do believe it would be inhibiting.,No
445,"And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.",No
446,"Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.",Yes
447,And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.,No
448,And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.,No
450,I do not favor abortion.,No
457,I haven't sorted out the penalties.,No
458,"But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.",No
460,"And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.",No
461,"And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",No
462,"And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.",No
463,"And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.",No
464,"Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.",No
465,"As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.",Yes
466,"See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.",No
468,"But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",No
470,"Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.",No
471,It's as simple as that.,No
472,"I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.",No
473,"This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.",No
474,"And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.",No
477,"Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.",No
478,I respect his right to disagree with me.,No
479,"But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.",No
487,"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.",No
488,"But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.",No
489,"That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.",No
490,I do strongly support the WIC program.,No
491,I think it is good.,No
492,"I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.",No
493,"But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.",No
494,"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.",No
495,"I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.",No
496,I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.,No
497,And so it's a combination of these things.,No
498,But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.,No
499,"The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.",No
500,I'm for Head Start and moving that up.,No
501,"And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.",No
503,"So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",No
505,"Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.",Yes
506,It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.,Yes
507,"And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.",No
508,Let me just give you one other example.,No
509,"We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.",Yes
510,"The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.",Yes
511,"It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.",Yes
512,That's the way you help people.,No
513,"Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.",No
514,I know what strong political leadership is.,No
515,I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.,No
516,"These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.",No
521,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.",No
522,Welfare reform is one way to do it.,No
523,"If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.",No
524,That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.,No
525,"In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.",Yes
526,One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.,No
527,Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.,No
528,"And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.",Yes
529,"So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.",No
530,"Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.",No
531,I know the private sector is.,No
532,People are all over the country.,No
533,But it takes presidential leadership.,No
534,It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.,No
535,And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.,No
537,"What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.",No
538,This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.,No
539,They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.,No
540,The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.,Yes
542,But here's the point he misses.,No
544,"But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.",Yes
545,"We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.",Yes
546,We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.,No
547,And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.,No
548,And we can do it.,No
549,"But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.",No
556,Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.,No
557,I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.,No
559,"And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.",No
560,Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.,No
561,It's not the length of your resume.,No
562,"It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.",No
563,"It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.",No
564,The vice president has a long resume.,No
565,But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.,No
566,"And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.",Yes
567,His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.,No
568,He went to Philippines in the early 80Ãâ‚¬s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.,No
569,"And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.",Yes
570,So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.,No
571,"The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.",No
572,I'm ready to provide that leadership.,No
573,I want to be the commander in chief of this country.,No
574,"I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.",Yes
575,But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.,No
578,"Well, I thought the question was about defense.",No
579,The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.,Yes
580,"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.",Yes
581,"Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.",No
582,That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.,No
584,Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.,No
586,But now we have a chance.,No
587,"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.",No
588,"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.",No
589,"As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.",No
590,It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.,Yes
592,"I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.",No
593,And he was down there fighting against imperialism.,No
596,And he just lifted martial law.,Yes
597,And he just called for new elections.,No
598,And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.,No
604,I don't think it's a question of eliminating.,No
605,I can tell him some I'm against.,No
608,And I can go on and on.,No
610,"I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.",No
612,"And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.",No
613,We're going to have to-the MX.,No
614,We're going to have to do that.,No
617,Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?,No
618,I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.,No
619,wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?,No
620,"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.",No
621,"Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.",No
622,But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.,No
623,We will do what we do best.,No
624,It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.,No
625,It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.,No
626,"But look, let me sum it up.",No
627,I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.,No
628,I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.,No
629,But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.,No
630,And I think I've had that.,No
632,"Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.",No
633,"As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.",No
634,"I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.",No
635,"But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.",No
636,We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.,Yes
637,Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.,No
638,"He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.",No
639,I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.,No
640,I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.,No
641,But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.,No
642,"I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.",No
643,But I don't think we need these other systems.,No
644,I don't think we need them to remain strong.,No
645,"We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.",No
650,"What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.",No
652,Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.,No
653,"Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.",No
654,"And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.",No
655,"And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.",No
656,And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.,No
658,We ought to say this is good.,No
659,But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.,No
660,"I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.",No
661,And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.,No
662,You see the turmoil in Poland today.,No
663,And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.,No
664,I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.,No
665,We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.,Yes
666,But this is an exciting time.,No
667,But all I'm suggesting is let's not be naÃƒÂ¯ve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.,No
668,Look at the INF treaty.,No
669,"And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.",No
670,The freeze people were wrong.,Yes
671,The Reagan-Bush administration was right.,No
673,It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.,No
674,"And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.",No
675,"Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.",No
676,What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.,No
677,"Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.",No
678,"And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.",No
679,We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.,No
680,"We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.",No
681,But there are opportunities there now.,No
682,Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.,No
683,Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.,No
684,"And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.",No
685,Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.,No
686,We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.,No
687,That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.,No
693,"No, there's been no change of heart.",No
694,"I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.",Yes
695,"But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.",Yes
697,"And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.",Yes
698,"So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.",No
699,"Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.Ã¢â€°Â¤ He hasn't told us where.",No
700,We know where they're cutting.,No
701,We know where you're cutting right now.,No
702,You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.,No
703,You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.,No
704,"An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.",Yes
705,"Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.",Yes
706,"They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.",No
707,You have to make choices.,No
708,We're not making those choices.,No
709,"And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.",No
710,"We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.",No
711,"We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.",Yes
713,"So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.",No
714,But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.,No
715,That's-at least that's what I read.,No
716,Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.,No
718,I'm not reconsidering my position.,No
719,Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.,No
720,Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.,No
721,He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.,No
722,"The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.",No
723,Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.,No
724,"And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.",Yes
727,Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?,No
728,"I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.",No
729,"We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.",No
730,That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.,Yes
737,"Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.",No
738,"These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.",No
739,"Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.",No
740,"But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.",No
741,"Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.",No
742,And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.,No
743,"As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.",Yes
744,"And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.",Yes
745,"So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.",No
746,We've got to be tough on international terrorism.,No
747,We've got to treat it as international crime.,No
748,"We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.",No
749,"We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.",No
751,"That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.",No
753,I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.,No
754,It is the best anti-terrorist report written.,No
755,"Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.",No
756,But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.,No
757,"Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.",Yes
758,And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.,No
761,"And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.",Yes
763,And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.,Yes
764,And I've said mistakes were made.,No
765,Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.,No
766,That is a very serious charge against the president.,No
767,The matter has been thoroughly looked into.,No
768,But the point is sometimes the action-,No
770,#NAME?,No
779,You're judged by the whole record.,No
780,You're judged by the entire record.,No
781,Are we closer to peace?,No
782,Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?,No
783,"Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?",Yes
784,How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.,No
785,Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?,No
786,You judge on the record.,No
787,Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?,No
788,"How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.",No
790,Now we have a chance.,No
791,Now we have a chance.,No
792,"And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.",No
793,And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.,No
794,"Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.",No
795,"He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.",No
797,I still have a couple of minutes left.,No
798,And there is a difference principle -,No
800,It's only on yellow here.,No
808,I said I wasn't perfect.,No
810,"25th of December, Mr. Vice President.",No
813,"He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.",No
815,"Well, the matter of judgment is very important.",No
817,A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.,Yes
819,The Vice President ignored them.,Yes
820,He says mistakes were made.,No
821,Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.,No
822,"He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.",Yes
823,Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.Ã¢â€°Â¤,Yes
824,"I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.",No
825,We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.,No
827,"If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.",No
829,It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.,No
835,"I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice.",No
836,I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s.,No
837,"I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we're in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won't have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.",Yes
838,I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them.,No
839,And I believe that he will be outstanding.,No
840,And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.,No
841,And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.,No
842,And he's kept his head up.,No
843,And he will do very very well.,No
844,And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.,No
845,"So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.",No
846,My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.,No
847,"Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.",No
848,And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.,No
850,"Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.",No
851,I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.,No
854,But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?,No
855,"No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.",No
856,"I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.",No
857,"I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.",No
858,Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.,No
859,I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.,No
860,"And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.",No
868,"Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.",No
869,I've picked a lot of people.,No
872,I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.,No
873,"I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.",No
874,But I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis.,No
875,"I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.",No
876,"Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.",No
878,We shouldn't do that.Ã¢â€°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.,No
879,"He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.",No
880,"When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.",No
881,And I'm very very proud of that choice.,No
882,And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.,No
883,"You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.",No
884,"The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.",No
886,I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.,No
889,"Well, I-we obviously have a difference.",No
890,I believe it does meet the test.,No
891,"We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.",No
894,I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.,No
895,But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.,No
896,But you talk about judgment.,No
897,"I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.",No
898,What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?,No
899,"I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.",No
900,"But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.",No
907,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.",No
908,And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.,No
909,But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.,Yes
910,"I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.",No
911,And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.,Yes
912,"I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.",No
913,"Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.",Yes
914,"I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.",No
915,But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.,No
916,"As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",Yes
918,I oppose supply management and production controls.,No
919,"I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.",No
920,I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.,No
921,I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.,No
922,"I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.",No
923,"In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.",No
924,"I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.",No
925,And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.,No
926,"I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.",No
927,"But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.",No
928,Let's try to expand our markets abroad.,No
936,I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.,No
937,But there are two main focal points of this election.,No
939,I want to keep this expansion going.,No
940,"Yes, we want change but we are the change.",No
945,The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.,No
946,"And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.",No
947,We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.,Yes
948,I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.,No
949,I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.,No
950,And then it gets down to a question of values.,No
951,We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.,No
952,And I do favor the death penalty.,No
953,And we've got a wide array of differences on those.,No
954,"But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Who has the values I believe in?",No
955,Who has the experience that we trust?,No
956,"Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?Ã¢â€°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.",No
959,This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.,No
960,We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.,No
961,"I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.",No
962,"You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream.",No
963,"They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.",No
964,I believe in the American dream.,No
965,"I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.",No
966,"With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.",No
967,With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.,No
968,"Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.",No
969,"It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.",No
970,"We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.",No
974,The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.,No
975,We live-we bring everybody along.,No
976,And the best America is not behind us.,No
977,The best America is yet to come.,No
1004,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.",No
1005,"Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.",No
1006,"I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.",No
1007,The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.,No
1008,I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.,No
1009,"I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.",No
1010,"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.",No
1013,"Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.",No
1015,"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?",No
1016,"No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.",Yes
1017,Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.,No
1018,But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.,No
1019,I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.,No
1020,"I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",Yes
1021,"With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.",No
1022,"Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.",No
1023,These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.,No
1026,Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.,No
1027,Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.,Yes
1028,The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.,No
1029,If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.,No
1030,The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.,No
1031,"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.",No
1032,"I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.",No
1033,"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country.""",No
1034,"I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.",No
1035,Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.,No
1038,"At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.",Yes
1039,"So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.",No
1040,"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.",No
1041,I know I'm ready for it.,No
1042,I think the American people are too.,No
1049,I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.,Yes
1050,"When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.",Yes
1051,"Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.",No
1052,And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.,No
1053,I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.,No
1054,And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.,No
1055,I don't know how to deal with it exactly.,No
1056,"Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.",Yes
1057,"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.",No
1058,"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.",No
1059,"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.",No
1060,"I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.",No
1061,"I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.",No
1064,"I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.",No
1065,"We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.",No
1066,They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.,No
1067,"Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.",No
1068,"Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.",Yes
1069,"But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.",No
1070,We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.,No
1071,"Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.",No
1072,"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.",No
1078,"Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.",No
1079,"And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.",Yes
1080,I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people.,Yes
1081,"I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.",Yes
1082,"Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.",No
1083,"Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it.",Yes
1084,"And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.",Yes
1085,"Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.",No
1086,"But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.",Yes
1087,"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no.""",No
1088,"But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.",No
1089,I think the matter is settled once and for all.,No
1093,That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.,No
1094,"I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that's as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House.",Yes
1095,"Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.",Yes
1096,And I've told everything I know about it.,No
1097,I think the matter is settled once and for all.,No
1099,I don't have a response.,No
1109,"In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.",No
1110,"One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.",No
1111,I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.,Yes
1112,"Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.",No
1113,"The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.",No
1114,"I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.",No
1115,And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.,No
1117,I certainly hope it won't.,No
1118,"I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.",No
1124,"I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.",No
1125,"I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.",No
1126,"There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.",No
1127,It's a fact they did.,Yes
1129,"It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.",No
1130,"And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.",No
1139,"I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.",No
1140,"And General Brown has indicated uh - his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter.",No
1141,"It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.",No
1142,"Not this one, however, that you bring up.",No
1143,General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.,Yes
1144,"He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.",No
1145,"And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.",No
1146,"Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.",Yes
1149,"Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.",No
1151,I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.,No
1152,This one concerned uh - Great Britain.,No
1153,I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.,Yes
1154,Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.,No
1155,"This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",No
1163,I don't believe it does.,No
1164,Uh - I began campaigning uh - twenty-two months ago.,No
1165,"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.",No
1166,Uh - very few people knew who I was.,No
1167,"I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.",No
1168,"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.",No
1169,"And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.",No
1170,"And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.",No
1171,"Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.",No
1172,"I'd say, several hundred of them.",No
1173,And they're very fine and very highly qualified.,No
1174,"The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.",No
1175,I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.,No
1176,I chose Senator Walter Mondale.,No
1177,"And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term.",No
1178,"And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.",No
1179,Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.,No
1180,"I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?",No
1181,I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.,No
1182,"In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.",No
1183,But I think this is indicative of what I would do.,No
1185,"The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.",No
1186,"And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.",No
1187,"I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.",No
1188,If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.,No
1189,"I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.",No
1190,Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.,No
1191,So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.,No
1192,"And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",No
1196,That's a tribute to their interest in this election.,No
1205,"I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.",Yes
1206,"Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.",Yes
1207,"So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.",Yes
1208,"The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.",Yes
1209,But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.,No
1210,"I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.",Yes
1211,"I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.",Yes
1212,Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.,Yes
1213,"For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.",Yes
1214,"And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.",Yes
1215,"And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",Yes
1217,"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.",No
1218,This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.,No
1219,Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.,Yes
1220,"The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill.",Yes
1221,And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.,Yes
1222,There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.,Yes
1223,"And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution.",Yes
1224,We have no energy policy.,Yes
1225,"We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.",No
1226,The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.,No
1227,"We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment.",No
1228,Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.,No
1229,"But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.",No
1230,"We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation.",No
1231,"And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.",Yes
1232,Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.,No
1239,"Yes, I'd be glad to.",No
1240,"In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy.",Yes
1241,"It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.",No
1243,"This has not been done, unfortunately.",No
1244,"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead.""",No
1245,I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.,No
1246,Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth.,Yes
1247,Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.,No
1248,And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.,No
1249,"Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.",No
1250,"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.",No
1251,We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.,Yes
1252,"When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.",Yes
1253,That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.,Yes
1254,"And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.",Yes
1256,"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.",Yes
1257,"And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.",No
1258,One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.,No
1259,And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.,No
1261,"Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.",No
1264,The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.,No
1265,"I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.",Yes
1266,In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.,Yes
1267,"In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.",Yes
1268,"We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.",No
1269,We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.,No
1270,"The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country.",No
1271,"As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead.",No
1272,"And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.",Yes
1278,"Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.",No
1279,"In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.",No
1280,"You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.",Yes
1281,"In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.",Yes
1282,"Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.",Yes
1283,"Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.",No
1284,The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh - black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established.,Yes
1285,"The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.",Yes
1286,"The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.",Yes
1287,"I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.",No
1289,The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.,No
1290,I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.,Yes
1291,This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.,Yes
1292,"There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.",No
1293,"I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.",No
1294,It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.,No
1295,"We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.",Yes
1296,The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.,Yes
1297,"Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.",Yes
1298,"There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.",Yes
1299,And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.,No
1300,We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.,Yes
1301,"And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.",No
1302,"And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.",No
1303,But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.,No
1304,It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.,No
1305,And that's been lacking in the last eight years.,No
1312,"Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.",No
1313,In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.,No
1314,We - quite often we have a transient problem.,No
1315,I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.,No
1317,I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.,No
1318,But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.,No
1319,"But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.",No
1320,"I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.",No
1321,"However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.",No
1322,"But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.",No
1324,"support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.",Yes
1325,I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.,No
1326,Uh I call that the people amendment.,No
1327,I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.,No
1328,Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.,No
1329,"Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.",No
1330,"Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.",No
1331,"So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.",No
1332,"I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.",No
1333,"And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.",No
1334,But they're matters that are ah - important.,No
1335,"And in those two cases, I would favor them.",No
1343,The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.,Yes
1344,"What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.",No
1345,If we make the use of a gun in the commission.,No
1346,"of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.",No
1347,I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.,No
1348,"That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.",No
1349,Those are the people who ought to be in jail.,No
1350,"And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.",No
1357,And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.,No
1358,The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.,No
1360,And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.,No
1361,You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.,No
1362,"And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.",No
1364,I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.,Yes
1365,"Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.",Yes
1366,And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.,No
1367,"I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.",No
1368,"And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.",Yes
1369,"I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.",No
1370,But that's as far as I would go with it.,No
1376,"While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.",Yes
1377,"We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.",No
1378,"And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.",Yes
1379,"Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.",Yes
1380,"And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.",No
1381,So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.,No
1382,"And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.",No
1383,"Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.",No
1384,"Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.",Yes
1385,"The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.",No
1386,The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.,No
1387,Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.,Yes
1388,Also the - the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh - confession.,No
1389,But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.,Yes
1390,And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.,Yes
1391,"But the only uh - thing I uh - have pointed out was, what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a - of a small technicality in the law.",No
1392,And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.,Yes
1394,"Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.",No
1395,"Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.",No
1396,"If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.",No
1397,Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.,No
1398,"I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.",No
1399,And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.,No
1400,I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.,No
1401,"He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.",Yes
1402,"The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.",No
1403,But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.,No
1404,And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.,No
1407,"I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.",No
1408,"I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming.",No
1409,"So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.",No
1410,"I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.",No
1411,"It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the - uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh - do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh - were properly handled and uh - sent to jail.",No
1412,"The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.",Yes
1413,"Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.",Yes
1418,"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.",No
1419,And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.,No
1420,Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.,No
1421,"Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.",Yes
1422,But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?,Yes
1423,"Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.",Yes
1424,"But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.",No
1425,But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.,No
1426,We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.,Yes
1427,We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.,Yes
1428,"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.",Yes
1429,"Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.",Yes
1430,And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.,No
1431,"The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.",Yes
1432,It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.,Yes
1439,"Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans.",No
1440,"Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.",Yes
1441,"Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.",Yes
1442,"In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy.",Yes
1443,And that means that there will be more industrial activity.,No
1444,It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.,No
1445,It means that there will be increased hires.,No
1446,It means that there will be increased employment.,No
1447,"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.",Yes
1449,We're ahead of all of the Western European country.,Yes
1451,"The United States is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year, year and a half ago.",Yes
1452,"We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.",No
1453,And I think this is a record that uh - the American people understand and will appreciate.,No
1455,"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.",Yes
1456,We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.,Yes
1457,"Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.",Yes
1458,"In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.",Yes
1460,Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.,No
1461,One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.,No
1462,There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.,No
1463,Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.,No
1465,Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,Yes
1467,And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.,No
1468,"I don't blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940.",Yes
1470,And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.,Yes
1471,And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.,Yes
1472,And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.,No
1473,He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.,Yes
1474,"We'll never have a balanced budget, we'll never meet the needs of our people, we'll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.",Yes
1475,"And we've probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they've given up hope.",Yes
1476,That is a very serious indictment of this administration.,No
1477,It's probably the worst one of all.,No
1484,"Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.",No
1485,"When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention.",No
1486,"At that time, uh - 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford.",Yes
1487,"But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.",No
1488,"And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread.",Yes
1489,"I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.",Yes
1490,"Uh - the polls uh - are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another.",No
1491,"And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.",No
1492,"I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.",No
1493,"As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.",Yes
1494,They had thirty-five people on the list.,No
1495,My name wasn't even there.,Yes
1496,And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.,Yes
1497,"So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.",No
1499,I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.,No
1500,I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.,No
1501,"In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.",Yes
1503,"And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.",Yes
1504,"So, the polls are interesting, but uh - I don't know how to explain the fluctuation.",No
1505,"I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.",No
1506,But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.,No
1507,"And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.",No
1508,And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.,No
1510,"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.",No
1511,He tends to distort on a number of occasions.,No
1512,"Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.",No
1513,He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.,No
1514,"We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.",Yes
1515,That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.,No
1516,At the present time we're at peace.,No
1518,We are not at war.,No
1519,We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.,Yes
1520,"If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.",No
1521,"But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.",No
1522,"So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.",Yes
1523,They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.,No
1530,For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.,No
1531,"I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions.",No
1532,"I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.",No
1533,"For the last two years, I've been the president, and I have found from experience that it's much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them.",No
1534,I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.,No
1535,"We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.",Yes
1536,The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.,No
1538,I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.,No
1539,But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.,No
1540,"During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another.",No
1541,But those are not the things that count.,No
1542,"What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.",No
1543,"As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.",No
1544,"The American people are healed, are working together.",No
1545,"The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction.",No
1547,We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.,No
1548,"There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.",No
1549,I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.,No
1551,Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight.,No
1552,We have peace with freedom.,No
1553,I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.,No
1555,"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it.""",No
1556,"Thank you, and good night.",No
1559,Thank you Barbara (barely audible).,No
1560,The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.,No
1561,"Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity.",No
1562,I don't believe the present administration has done that.,No
1563,We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.,No
1564,Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.,No
1565,"Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal.",No
1566,But our country is innately very strong.,No
1567,"Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.",No
1568,"I'd like to ask the American people what, what's been accomplished.",No
1569,A lot remains to be done.,No
1570,My own background is different from his.,No
1572,I served an a hospital authority.,No
1573,"And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I'm an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman.",No
1574,"And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.",No
1575,"Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.",No
1577,We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.,Yes
1578,"As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.",Yes
1579,"We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.",Yes
1580,We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.,Yes
1581,And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.,Yes
1584,Employment ought to be restored to our people.,No
1585,We've become almost a welfare state.,No
1586,We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.,Yes
1587,Our people wanna go back to work.,No
1588,Our education system can be improved.,No
1589,Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.,No
1590,Our housing programs have uh - gone bad.,Yes
1591,It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.,Yes
1592,But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.,Yes
1593,The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.,Yes
1594,"Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.",No
1595,This doesn't have to be.,No
1598,"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now.""",No
1599,"I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.",No
1601,There are no magic answers to do it.,No
1602,But I believe together we can make great progress.,No
1603,We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.,No
1605,We've been drifting too long.,No
1606,We've been dormant too long.,No
1607,We've been discouraged too long.,No
1608,And we have not set an example for our own people.,No
1609,"But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.",No
1610,And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.,No
1611,And let the world know - that's very important.,No
1612,"But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.",No
1654,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity.",No
1655,I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.,No
1656,"There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.",No
1657,"And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.",No
1659,"You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",Yes
1660,"Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.",Yes
1661,The financial system had frozen up.,Yes
1662,"And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.",No
1663,"Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.",Yes
1664,The auto industry has come roaring back.,No
1665,And housing has begun to rise.,Yes
1666,But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.,No
1667,"And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.",No
1668,"Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.",Yes
1670,I think we've got to invest in education and training.,No
1671,"I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.",No
1672,"Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take.",No
1673,Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?,No
1677,"It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.",No
1678,"I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.",No
1679,"And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.",No
1680,"I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me.",No
1684,This is obviously a very tender topic.,No
1685,I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country.,No
1688,"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs.",No
1689,He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home.,No
1691,"And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.",No
1692,"Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.",No
1693,That's not what I'm going to do.,No
1694,My plan has five basic parts.,No
1695,"One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.",No
1696,That creates about 4 million jobs.,Yes
1697,"Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",No
1699,"Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.",No
1700,We're far away from that now.,No
1701,"Number four, get to us a balanced budget.",No
1702,"Number five, champion small business.",No
1703,"It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.",Yes
1704,"Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.",No
1705,"The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.",Yes
1706,That's not the right answer for America.,No
1707,I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.,No
1710,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.",No
1711,"First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.",Yes
1712,"We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.",Yes
1713,"So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now.",No
1714,And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.,No
1715,"When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.",Yes
1716,But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,No
1717,I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.,No
1718,"On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.",Yes
1719,"But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",No
1720,So all of this is possible.,No
1721,"Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?",No
1722,"And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?",No
1723,"And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.",Yes
1725,"How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",No
1729,I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.,No
1730,"First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.",Yes
1731,I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.,Yes
1732,My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.,No
1733,But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.,No
1734,High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.,No
1735,They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.,No
1736,The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.,No
1737,"Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.",No
1739,"Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.",Yes
1740,This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.,No
1741,I'll call it the economy tax.,No
1743,"At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.",Yes
1747,Middle-income families are being crushed.,No
1748,And so the question is how to get them going again.,No
1750,"It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.",No
1751,Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.,No
1752,But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.,No
1754,"I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.",No
1755,"But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.",Yes
1757,We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.,No
1758,"The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.",No
1759,"And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.",No
1760,"But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.",Yes
1762,"Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.",Yes
1763,But not due to his policies.,No
1764,In spite of his policies.,No
1765,"Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.",Yes
1766,"On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.",Yes
1767,"If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.",No
1768,And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.,No
1769,"And, by the way, I like coal.",No
1770,I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.,No
1771,People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.,Yes
1772,I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.,No
1773,"And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.",No
1774,"My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.",No
1775,I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.,No
1776,But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.,No
1777,"And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.",No
1778,So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.,No
1780,"Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.",No
1781,"Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.",Yes
1782,And that's exactly what I did.,Yes
1783,"We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.",Yes
1784,"And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.",No
1785,"And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.",No
1786,They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.,No
1787,"They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.",Yes
1788,"Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.",Yes
1789,And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.,Yes
1790,"The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.",Yes
1791,"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.",No
1793,"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.",Yes
1794,And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.,No
1795,"The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.",Yes
1796,"Now, that's not my analysis.",No
1797,That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.,Yes
1798,"And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.",Yes
1806,"Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.",No
1808,"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.",No
1809,I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.,No
1810,What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.,No
1812,So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.,No
1813,"Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.",No
1814,"I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.",No
1815,"Look, I've got five boys.",No
1816,"I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.",No
1817,But that -- that is not the case.,No
1819,I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.,No
1820,"And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families.",No
1821,I will lower taxes on middle-income families.,No
1822,"Now, you cite a study.",No
1823,There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.,Yes
1824,"I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.",No
1825,There are all these studies out there.,No
1826,But let's get at the bottom line.,No
1827,"That is, I want to bring down rates.",No
1828,"I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.",No
1829,"And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?",No
1830,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.",Yes
1831,"And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.",No
1832,"For me, this is about jobs.",No
1833,This is about getting jobs for the American people.,No
1838,"Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.",Yes
1839,"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind.""",No
1840,"And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.",Yes
1843,"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.",No
1844,"So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.",Yes
1845,And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.,No
1846,"But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.",Yes
1847,"And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",No
1848,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.",No
1849,"Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.",No
1850,"Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.",Yes
1851,"But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.",Yes
1852,Donald Trump is a small business.,No
1853,"Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.",No
1854,"And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.",No
1855,And I think that would be a mistake.,No
1857,"Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...",No
1860,... the small businesses we're talking about...,No
1872,"Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate.",Yes
1873,But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.,Yes
1874,Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.,Yes
1875,And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.,Yes
1876,"Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.",No
1877,He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.,No
1879,"He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.",No
1880,It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.,Yes
1881,And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.,Yes
1882,"The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.",Yes
1883,I don't want to cost jobs.,No
1885,"And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.",No
1886,That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.,No
1887,"Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.",No
1888,"If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.",Yes
1889,"But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.",No
1892,"The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",Yes
1893,Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.,No
1894,We created 23 million new jobs.,Yes
1895,We went from deficit to surplus.,Yes
1896,And businesses did very well.,No
1897,"So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.",No
1898,"Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.",No
1902,"Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.",No
1903,I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.,No
1904,Let me just make this comment.,No
1906,"I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.",No
1907,I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.,No
1909,My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.,No
1911,"So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.",Yes
1912,"Number two, let's look at history.",No
1913,My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.,Yes
1914,"My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.",No
1915,My priority is putting people back to work in America.,No
1916,They're suffering in this country.,No
1917,And we talk about evidence.,No
1918,Look at the evidence of the last four years.,No
1920,We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.,Yes
1921,"It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.",Yes
1922,Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.,No
1929,"I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.",No
1930,"I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.",No
1931,"I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.",No
1932,"And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.",Yes
1933,So how do we deal with it?,No
1934,"Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.",No
1935,"One, of course, is to raise taxes.",No
1936,Number two is to cut spending.,No
1937,"And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.",No
1938,The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.,No
1940,The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.,Yes
1941,And you could never quite get the job done.,No
1942,I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.,No
1944,"Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?",No
1945,"And if not, I'll get rid of it.",No
1948,"I use that term with all respect, by the way.",No
1952,So I'll get rid of that.,No
1953,"I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.",No
1954,I'm going to stop other things.,No
1955,"I like PBS, I love Big Bird.",No
1957,But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.,No
1959,"Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.",No
1960,"Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.",No
1961,"My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.",No
1962,This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.,No
1963,The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.,Yes
1965,Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.,Yes
1966,The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.,Yes
1968,"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.",Yes
1969,And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.,No
1970,"And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.",No
1971,"So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.",Yes
1972,And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.,Yes
1973,That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.,Yes
1974,"Now, we all know that we've got to do more.",No
1975,And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.,Yes
1977,"You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.",No
1978,"And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.",Yes
1979,Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.,No
1980,"Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",No
1981,And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.,No
1982,"Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.",No
1983,"You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?",No
1985,"Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.",No
1986,It means that Governor Romney...,No
1988,"... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.",Yes
1990,And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.,No
1995,"Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.",No
1997,I have my own plan.,No
1998,It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.,No
1999,"But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.",No
2000,"If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.",No
2001,"That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...",Yes
2002,But you've been -- but you've been president four years...,No
2004,You've been president four years.,No
2005,You said you'd cut the deficit in half.,Yes
2006,It's now four years later.,No
2007,We still have trillion-dollar deficits.,Yes
2008,The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.,Yes
2009,"If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.",Yes
2010,"I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.",Yes
2011,And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.,No
2012,"You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.",Yes
2013,That doesn't get the job done.,No
2014,"Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?",No
2015,Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?,No
2016,"And actually, you said it back in 2010.",No
2017,"You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone.""",Yes
2018,"Well, the economy is still growing slow.",Yes
2019,"As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.",Yes
2020,"And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.",No
2021,And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.,No
2022,It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.,No
2023,It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.,Yes
2024,You raise taxes and you kill jobs.,No
2025,"That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.",Yes
2026,I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.,No
2027,I'll make one more point.,No
2032,"Well, we've had this discussion before.",No
2034,There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.,No
2035,"Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.",Yes
2040,"Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.",Yes
2041,That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.,No
2042,"But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.",No
2043,You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.,No
2044,Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.,Yes
2045,We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.,Yes
2046,I don't want to go down the path to Spain.,No
2047,I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.,No
2051,"If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.",No
2052,"And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.",No
2053,Let's talk about corporate taxes.,No
2054,"Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.",No
2056,"Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.",Yes
2057,"Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?",No
2058,Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?,No
2059,Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?,No
2060,"My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.",No
2061,"When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.",Yes
2062,"Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.",No
2063,And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,No
2064,"Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.",No
2065,I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.,No
2066,And all that raises revenue.,No
2067,"And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.",No
2068,"It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.",No
2069,"The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.",No
2070,They're using text books that are 10 years old.,Yes
2071,That is not a recipe for growth.,No
2072,That's not how America was built.,No
2073,And so budgets reflect choices.,No
2074,"Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.",No
2075,"And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.",No
2076,"And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.",No
2077,"As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.",Yes
2078,"Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.",No
2080,There's no doubt about it.,No
2081,But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.,No
2082,What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.,No
2083,"Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...",No
2086,"... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.",No
2087,So let's go through them one by one.,No
2088,"First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.",Yes
2089,"And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.",No
2091,It's time to end it.,No
2092,"And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.",Yes
2093,"Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.",Yes
2094,And you say Exxon and Mobil.,No
2095,"Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.",Yes
2096,"But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.",No
2097,Of course it's on the table.,No
2098,That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.,No
2099,"But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.",Yes
2100,"I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?",No
2101,So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.,No
2102,"The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.",No
2103,"Look, I've been in business for 25 years.",No
2104,I have no idea what you're talking about.,No
2105,I maybe need to get a new accountant.,No
2107,But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.,No
2109,What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.,No
2110,"And, finally, Medicaid to states?",No
2111,"I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.",No
2112,"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.",No
2113,We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.,No
2114,So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.,No
2115,Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.,No
2117,"And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.",No
2119,"But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.",No
2128,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.",No
2129,Social Security is structurally sound.,No
2130,It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.,No
2131,But it is -- the basic structure is sound.,No
2132,"But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.",No
2133,"You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.",No
2135,My grandfather died a while back.,No
2137,And she was fiercely independent.,No
2138,"She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.",No
2139,And she ended up living alone by choice.,No
2140,And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.,No
2141,"She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.",No
2142,And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.,No
2143,"You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.",No
2144,"These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",No
2145,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?",No
2146,"And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.",No
2147,$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.,Yes
2149,So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.,No
2150,"When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",No
2153,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.",No
2154,"And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.",Yes
2155,"So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.",No
2157,"Oh, I just thought about one.",No
2158,"And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.",No
2159,In fact he is on Medicare.,Yes
2160,On Social Security he's not.,No
2161,"But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.",Yes
2162,"Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.",Yes
2163,"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.""",Yes
2164,That's not just going after places where there's abuse.,No
2165,That's saying we're cutting the rates.,No
2166,Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.,Yes
2167,We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.,Yes
2168,This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.,Yes
2169,I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.,Yes
2170,"Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.",No
2171,We're going to give a better prescription program.,No
2172,That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.,Yes
2173,They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.,No
2174,I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.,Yes
2175,"By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.",No
2176,"But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.",No
2177,"And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",No
2179,"First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.",No
2180,And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.,Yes
2181,"It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.",No
2185,And let me explain why.,No
2188,"... people, right, not for current retirees.",No
2189,"For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.",Yes
2190,"The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.",Yes
2191,"The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.",Yes
2192,"Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.",No
2193,"But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.",No
2194,"They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.",Yes
2195,"And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.",No
2196,And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.,No
2197,"So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.",No
2198,And this is not my own -- only my opinion.,No
2199,"AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.",Yes
2200,Benefits were not affected at all.,Yes
2201,"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care.",Yes
2202,They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.,Yes
2203,And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.,Yes
2204,And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.,No
2207,What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.,No
2208,And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.,Yes
2211,So that's -- that's number one.,No
2212,"Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.",No
2214,They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.,No
2215,"So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.",Yes
2216,That's not going to happen.,No
2217,They'll have at least two plans.,Yes
2218,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.",No
2219,I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.,No
2220,I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.,No
2221,I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.,No
2222,"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.",No
2223,But people make their own choice.,No
2224,The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?,No
2225,"We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.",No
2226,We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.,No
2227,That's the plan that I've put forward.,No
2228,"And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.",Yes
2229,"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.",No
2231,"Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.",Yes
2232,And private insurers have to make a profit.,No
2235,"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.",No
2236,"And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.",No
2237,"And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.",No
2238,"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.",No
2239,And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.,No
2240,And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.,No
2241,One last point I want to make.,No
2242,"We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... ",No
2243,... but -- but -- but overall.,No
2246,That's -- that's a big topic.,No
2247,Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?,No
2248,Is that a -- is that a separate topic?,No
2253,Let's get back to Medicare.,No
2255,Let's get back to Medicare.,No
2257,The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.,No
2259,"If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.",No
2261,But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.,No
2276,You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.,No
2277,"As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.",No
2279,You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.,No
2280,"I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.",No
2281,Every free economy has good regulation.,No
2282,"At the same time, regulation can become excessive.",No
2288,"No, it can become out of date.",No
2289,"And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.",Yes
2290,Let me give you an example.,No
2292,And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.,Yes
2293,"One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.",Yes
2294,This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.,No
2295,This is an enormous boon for them.,No
2296,There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.,Yes
2301,"Well, I would repeal and replace it.",No
2302,We're not going to get rid of all regulation.,No
2303,You have to have regulation.,No
2304,And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.,No
2305,"You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...",No
2308,But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.,No
2313,I think this is a great example.,No
2314,The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.,No
2315,"Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.",No
2316,"You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.",Yes
2317,You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.,No
2318,You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.,Yes
2319,"But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.",No
2320,So what did we do?,No
2321,We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.,Yes
2322,"We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.",No
2323,You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.,No
2324,We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.,No
2325,"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.",Yes
2326,"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.",Yes
2327,"And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.",No
2328,"But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.",Yes
2329,And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?,No
2330,"Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.",No
2331,But that's not what I believe.,No
2332,"Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.",No
2333,"Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.",No
2334,That's why I'd have regulation.,No
2335,But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.,No
2336,That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.,Yes
2337,It wasn't thought through properly.,No
2338,We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.,No
2340,Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.,No
2341,You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.,No
2343,It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.,No
2344,"And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.",Yes
2346,We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,No
2347,"So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.",Yes
2348,Try and get a mortgage these days.,No
2349,It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.,Yes
2350,It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.,No
2351,Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.,No
2352,"I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.",No
2362,"Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.",No
2364,"A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.",No
2365,"I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.",No
2366,"And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.",No
2367,And -- and we've got to deal with cost.,No
2368,"And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.",Yes
2369,So it's adding to cost.,Yes
2370,"And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.",Yes
2371,"Instead, it's gone up by that amount.",Yes
2374,So that's one reason I don't want it.,No
2375,"Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.",Yes
2376,I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.,No
2377,"Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.",No
2378,I don't like that idea.,No
2379,"Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?",No
2380,And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.,Yes
2381,"I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.",Yes
2383,And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.,No
2384,"And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.",No
2386,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.",No
2387,And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.,Yes
2388,"It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.",Yes
2389,"If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.",No
2390,"If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.",No
2391,"And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.",No
2392,"So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.",Yes
2393,And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.,No
2394,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.",No
2395,You keep your own insurance.,No
2396,You keep your own doctor.,Yes
2397,But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.,No
2398,They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.,Yes
2399,They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.,Yes
2400,And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.,Yes
2401,"Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.",Yes
2402,"Now, the last point I'd make before...",No
2404,"No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...",No
2406,"... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.",Yes
2408,"And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",No
2412,"Well, I did with my first statement.",No
2414,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.",No
2415,"I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.",No
2416,What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.,Yes
2417,"As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.",Yes
2418,"So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.",Yes
2419,"What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.",Yes
2422,You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.,Yes
2424,"Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.",Yes
2425,We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.,Yes
2426,"We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.",No
2427,"Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.",Yes
2428,"And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.",Yes
2429,"So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.",Yes
2430,"It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.",No
2431,They put a plan out.,No
2432,"They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.",Yes
2434,"I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.",No
2435,And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.,No
2436,Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.,No
2437,This was a bipartisan idea.,Yes
2438,"In fact, it was a Republican idea.",Yes
2439,And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.,No
2440,"And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.",Yes
2441,"It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?",No
2442,Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.,No
2443,"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",No
2444,"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?",No
2445,And there are ways of doing it.,No
2446,"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.",Yes
2447,And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.,No
2448,"They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.",No
2449,Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.,No
2450,Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.,No
2451,"Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.",No
2452,"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.",No
2454,So we're already beginning to see progress.,Yes
2455,"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.",Yes
2456,Let me make one last point.,No
2457,"Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.",No
2458,"But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.",Yes
2459,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.",No
2460,"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...",Yes
2462,... at a time when it's vitally important.,No
2468,"Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.",No
2469,"But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.",Yes
2470,"Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.",No
2471,That's already offered in the private marketplace.,Yes
2472,You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.,No
2473,"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.",No
2474,"And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.",Yes
2476,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.",No
2477,"As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.",No
2478,"Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.",No
2479,This is the private market.,No
2480,"These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.",No
2481,"I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.",No
2482,I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.,No
2483,"In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.",No
2484,"We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.",No
2485,"Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",Yes
2486,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.",No
2487,That's the wrong way to go.,No
2488,The private market and individual responsibility always work best.,Yes
2489,Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.,Yes
2490,That's explicitly prohibited in the law.,Yes
2491,"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.",Yes
2492,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.",No
2493,"What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.",Yes
2494,But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.,Yes
2495,There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.,No
2496,It wasn't a government takeover of health care.,Yes
2497,It was the largest expansion of private insurance.,Yes
2498,"But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody.""",No
2499,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers.",No
2500,"But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",Yes
2501,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.",No
2502,"That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.",No
2503,"He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.",No
2505,He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.,Yes
2506,"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?",No
2507,Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?,No
2509,"The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.",No
2510,And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.,Yes
2513,I -- I have to respond to that.,No
2515,"Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done.",No
2516,What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.,No
2517,"When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.",No
2518,He said he was going to lower tax rates.,Yes
2519,He said he was going to broaden the base.,No
2520,"You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.",Yes
2522,I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.,No
2523,"And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?",No
2524,"One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.",No
2525,"Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.",No
2526,Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.,No
2527,And then that number disappears for high-income people.,Yes
2528,That's one way one could do it.,No
2529,One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.,No
2530,"There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.",No
2531,"And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.",Yes
2532,You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.,No
2533,"In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.",No
2534,That's part of my health care plan.,Yes
2535,And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.,No
2536,And I said that at that time.,No
2537,"The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.",Yes
2544,"Well, I definitely think there are differences.",No
2546,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.,No
2547,That's its most basic function.,No
2548,"And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.",No
2549,"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.",No
2550,"Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",No
2551,"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.",No
2552,"So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.",Yes
2553,That doesn't restrict people's freedom.,No
2555,And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.,No
2556,And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.,Yes
2557,We use something called Race to the Top.,No
2558,"Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.",No
2559,"What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.",Yes
2560,"And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.",Yes
2561,"But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.",Yes
2562,And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.,No
2563,"In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.",Yes
2564,"I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",No
2565,"It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.",No
2566,And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.,No
2569,"Well, first, I love great schools.",No
2570,"Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.",Yes
2571,"And the key to great schools, great teachers.",No
2572,So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.,No
2573,"Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.",No
2574,The role of government: Look behind us.,No
2575,The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.,No
2576,The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.,No
2578,"We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.",No
2579,I do not believe in cutting our military.,No
2580,I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.,No
2581,"Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.",No
2582,That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.,No
2583,"I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.",No
2584,"We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.",No
2586,"And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.",No
2587,But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.,No
2588,"And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.",No
2590,And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.,Yes
2592,The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.,Yes
2593,The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.,Yes
2595,We know that the path we're taking is not working.,No
2596,It's time for a new path.,No
2601,"Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.",No
2602,But the federal government also can play a very important role.,No
2603,"And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.",No
2604,The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.,No
2605,"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.",No
2606,"I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.",No
2607,"So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.",No
2609,"Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.",No
2610,"Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.",Yes
2612,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.",Yes
2613,"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.",Yes
2614,"You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",Yes
2615,And it wasn't very detailed.,No
2616,This seems to be a trend.,No
2617,"But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",Yes
2618,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.",No
2619,And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...,No
2621,Let me just finish the point.,No
2623,The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.,No
2624,And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.,No
2625,"That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.",Yes
2626,Let me just say one final example.,No
2627,"When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.",Yes
2628,"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.",Yes
2629,"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?""",No
2630,"And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.",Yes
2631,And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.,No
2632,"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.",No
2633,"And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.",No
2634,It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.,No
2638,"Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.",No
2639,"All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.",No
2640,I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.,No
2641,I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.,No
2642,So I'm not planning on making changes there.,No
2643,"But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.",No
2644,You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.,Yes
2645,"And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.",No
2646,"$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.",Yes
2648,"And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.",Yes
2649,A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.,Yes
2650,"Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.",Yes
2651,"The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?",No
2652,How do we get schools to be more competitive?,No
2654,"I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.",No
2655,I don't want to cut our commitment to education.,No
2656,I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.,No
2657,"And by the way, I've had that experience.",No
2658,I don't just talk about it.,No
2660,Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.,Yes
2661,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.,No
2662,It's because I care about education for all of our kids.,No
2669,You've done a great job.,No
2677,"Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.",No
2678,And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.,No
2679,We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.,No
2680,We cut taxes 19 times.,Yes
2682,"We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.",No
2683,"We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.",No
2684,"And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.",No
2685,And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.,No
2686,"What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.",No
2689,But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.,No
2693,"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.",No
2695,"But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.",No
2696,That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.,No
2697,That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.,Yes
2698,That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.,Yes
2699,"That's how we repealed ""don't ask/don't tell.""",No
2700,"That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.",No
2701,That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.,No
2702,So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.,No
2703,"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan.",No
2704,"Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.",No
2705,"And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?",No
2706,"Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.",No
2707,"When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.",No
2709,"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.",No
2710,"And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",No
2714,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.",No
2715,And I want to thank the University of Denver.,No
2716,"You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.",Yes
2717,And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.,No
2718,"And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.",No
2719,"The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.",Yes
2720,And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.,No
2721,"And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.",No
2722,"All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.",No
2723,And everybody's getting a fair shot.,No
2724,"And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.",No
2725,"You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.",No
2726,And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.,No
2727,"But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.",No
2728,"I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.",No
2730,"Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.",No
2731,And thank you for tuning in this evening.,No
2732,This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.,No
2733,I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.,No
2734,I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.,No
2735,It's bigger than our respective parties.,No
2736,It's an election about the course of America.,No
2737,What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.,No
2738,"And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.",No
2739,We're talk about those two paths.,No
2740,But they lead in very different directions.,No
2741,And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.,No
2742,You can look at the record.,No
2743,There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.,No
2744,I'll get incomes up again.,No
2746,We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.,Yes
2747,If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.,No
2748,"If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.",No
2749,In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.,No
2751,"You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.",No
2752,If I'm elected we won't have Obama.,No
2753,We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.,No
2754,If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.,Yes
2755,You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.,Yes
2756,You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.,No
2757,I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.,No
2759,The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.,No
2760,The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.,Yes
2761,I will not cut our commitment to our military.,No
2762,I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.,No
2792,"Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.",No
2793,"We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.",No
2794,"In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.",No
2795,Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.,No
2796,We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.,No
2797,"We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.",No
2798,We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.,No
2799,It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.,No
2800,"In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.",No
2801,"We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.",No
2802,In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.,No
2804,"The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.",No
2805,We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.,No
2806,The other point I wanna make is about our defense.,No
2807,"We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.",No
2808,"The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.",No
2809,"And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.",No
2810,Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.,Yes
2811,This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.,No
2812,"I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.",No
2813,"Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.",No
2814,That's got to be changed.,No
2815,And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.,No
2817,Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.,No
2818,Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.,No
2819,Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.,Yes
2820,"A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.",Yes
2821,"And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.",Yes
2822,There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.,No
2823,Now let me just tell you a little story.,No
2824,"About uh - late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh - three to five billion dollars.",Yes
2825,"A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand.",Yes
2826,"We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.",No
2827,We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.,Yes
2828,That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.,Yes
2829,Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.,No
2830,You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.,No
2831,And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.,No
2839,I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.,No
2840,"I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.",No
2841,"I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.",No
2843,"We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.",No
2845,We have a democracy in Portugal today.,No
2846,"A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.",Yes
2847,"Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.",Yes
2848,"The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.",Yes
2849,The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.,Yes
2850,"The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.",No
2851,But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.,No
2852,The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.,No
2853,We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.,No
2854,We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.,No
2856,We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.,No
2857,"We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.",Yes
2858,The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.,No
2859,The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.,No
2860,"And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.",No
2861,"And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?",No
2862,I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.,No
2863,Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.,Yes
2864,"I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",No
2865,"Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.",Yes
2866,I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.,Yes
2867,That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.,No
2868,"I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.",No
2869,"As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.",Yes
2870,"As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.",Yes
2871,About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars.,Yes
2872,"After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.",Yes
2873,"When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.",Yes
2874,"Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.",Yes
2875,And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.,Yes
2876,"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.",No
2877,"Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.",No
2878,"We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.",No
2885,"Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.",No
2886,I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.,No
2887,"But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.",No
2889,"Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.",No
2890,"I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.",No
2891,I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.,No
2892,I've talked to them and I've listened.,No
2893,"And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.",No
2894,"What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.",No
2895,"And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.",No
2896,I believe I know what this country ought to be.,No
2897,"I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.",No
2898,"Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.",No
2899,"If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.",No
2900,"And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.",Yes
2901,"This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.",No
2903,"So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.",No
2904,Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.,No
2905,"But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.",No
2908,"First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.",No
2909,"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.",Yes
2910,"Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.",Yes
2911,The American people don't know what those commitments are.,No
2912,"We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.",Yes
2913,These kinds of things have hurt us very much.,No
2914,"I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.",No
2915,And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.,No
2916,When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.,No
2917,"Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.",No
2918,But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.,No
2919,"The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.",Yes
2920,This is a responsibility of the president.,No
2921,And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.,No
2923,Governor Carter again contradicts himself.,No
2924,He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.,Yes
2925,But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.,No
2926,After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.,Yes
2927,"But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.",Yes
2928,It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.,No
2929,"Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.",Yes
2930,The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.,Yes
2931,The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.,Yes
2932,I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.,No
2943,I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.,Yes
2944,And let me cite several examples.,No
2945,"Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.",Yes
2946,"I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.",Yes
2947,It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.,No
2948,The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.,No
2949,"We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.",Yes
2950,And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and - the oil that we have bought from overseas.,Yes
2951,"If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.",No
2952,"In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.",Yes
2954,"And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.",No
2955,"Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?",No
2956,"Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.",Yes
2958,"In both cases where they've done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.",Yes
2961,"I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.",No
2962,I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.,No
2963,I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.,No
2964,"Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.",Yes
2965,"As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.",No
2967,"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.",No
2968,I was talking about Mr. Ford.,No
2969,The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.,No
2970,"In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.",Yes
2972,"We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.",Yes
2973,And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.,No
2974,We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.,No
2975,He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.,No
2977,He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.,No
2978,"The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.",Yes
2979,"The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.",Yes
2980,His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott.,Yes
2981,They didn't volunteer the information.,Yes
2982,He had to be subpoenaed.,No
2983,"And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.",Yes
2984,"That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.",No
2990,I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.,No
2991,"If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.",No
2992,"For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.",No
2993,"I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.",No
2994,I wouldn't single out just food.,No
2995,"Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.",No
2996,"When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.",Yes
2997,"The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.",No
2998,Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.,Yes
2999,Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.,Yes
3000,"Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.",Yes
3001,"If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.",Yes
3002,"This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.",No
3003,We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.,No
3004,And it's an overall sign of weakness.,No
3005,"When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.",No
3006,"It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.",No
3007,But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.,Yes
3008,"These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.",No
3009,It's a matter of being tough.,No
3010,It's a matter of being strong.,No
3011,It's a matter of being consistent.,No
3012,"Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.",No
3014,And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.,Yes
3015,This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.,No
3019,"If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.",No
3020,And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.,No
3021,I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.,Yes
3023,Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.,Yes
3025,"So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.",No
3026,I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.,No
3027,He indicates he would not make those.,No
3028,Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.,Yes
3030,"The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.",No
3031,"It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.",No
3032,"The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.",No
3033,"In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.",Yes
3034,Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.,Yes
3035,"I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.",No
3036,It's for their security as well as ours.,No
3042,"Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.",Yes
3043,It doesn't set a times schedule.,No
3044,It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.,No
3045,"The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.",Yes
3046,"The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.",No
3047,"The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.",No
3048,"We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.",No
3049,"And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.",No
3051,"There is no policy of this government to give to the People's Republic, or to sell to the People's Republic of China, military equipment.",Yes
3052,"I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.",No
3054,"Well, I'd like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh - Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid.",No
3055,"As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.",Yes
3056,"Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.",Yes
3057,We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.,Yes
3058,And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.,No
3059,"There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.",No
3060,In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.,No
3061,"We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.",No
3062,But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.,No
3067,"Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.",No
3068,These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.,No
3069,We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.,Yes
3070,Our allies feel that we've neglected them.,No
3071,The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.,No
3072,"Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.",No
3074,The worst inflation since the Great Depression.,Yes
3075,The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.,Yes
3076,"We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.",Yes
3077,Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.,Yes
3078,And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.,No
3079,We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.,Yes
3080,And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.,No
3081,So strong economy is very important.,No
3082,Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.,No
3084,"And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.",No
3085,And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.,No
3086,"Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.",No
3087,Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.,No
3088,"What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.",No
3089,We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.,No
3091,But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.,No
3095,"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.",Yes
3096,The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.,Yes
3097,The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.,Yes
3098,"So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.",No
3099,I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.,No
3100,"But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.",No
3101,"They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.",No
3103,Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.,No
3104,In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.,Yes
3105,He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.,Yes
3106,Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.,No
3107,Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.,No
3108,"As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.",Yes
3109,In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.,No
3112,Our relations with Japan have never been better.,No
3113,I was the first United States president to visit Japan.,No
3114,And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.,Yes
3115,You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.,No
3116,"Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.",Yes
3124,First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.,Yes
3125,Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.,No
3126,"As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.",Yes
3127,Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.,No
3128,"At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.",Yes
3129,"Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.",Yes
3131,"In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.",Yes
3132,Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.,Yes
3133,"But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.",No
3134,"I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.",No
3135,"Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.",Yes
3136,"So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",No
3140,"They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.",No
3141,"At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.",No
3142,"And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.",No
3143,"I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.",No
3145,"Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.",No
3146,"He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.",Yes
3147,"He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.",No
3148,"We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.",No
3149,"As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.",No
3150,I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.,No
3151,"Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.",No
3152,"I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.",Yes
3153,I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.,Yes
3154,Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.,Yes
3155,We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.,No
3156,"Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.",Yes
3157,This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.,No
3158,We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.,Yes
3159,If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.,No
3160,This has got to be stopped.,No
3161,That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.,No
3166,"No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.",No
3167,I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.,No
3168,I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.,No
3169,"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",No
3170,"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.",No
3171,And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.,No
3172,We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.,Yes
3173,We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.,Yes
3174,This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.,No
3175,And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.,No
3176,"So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.",No
3178,Under this administration that strength has not been realized.,No
3180,Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.,No
3181,"I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.",Yes
3182,Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.,No
3183,"I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.",No
3184,"But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.",No
3185,The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.,No
3186,The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.,No
3187,"What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?",No
3188,What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?,Yes
3189,The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.,No
3190,"What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?",No
3191,Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.,No
3203,I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.,No
3204,And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.,No
3205,"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.",No
3206,"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.",No
3207,"So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.",No
3208,And I believe that we used our skill.,No
3209,"Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.",Yes
3210,"He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.",Yes
3211,"Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.",Yes
3212,"This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.",No
3213,"And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.",No
3214,There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.,No
3215,"But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.",Yes
3216,"And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.",No
3217,And we will do it with the highest moral principles.,No
3220,"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.",No
3221,Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.,No
3222,I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.,No
3223,But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.,No
3224,"On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.",Yes
3225,South Korea faces a very delicate situation.,No
3226,"Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.",Yes
3227,"This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",No
3229,I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.,No
3230,"This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.",Yes
3231,This has not been an ancient history story.,No
3232,"Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.",Yes
3233,Another point I wanna make is this.,No
3234,He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.,Yes
3235,That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.,No
3236,"While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.",No
3237,We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.,Yes
3238,"Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.",Yes
3239,Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.,No
3240,Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.,No
3241,I don't agree with that statement.,No
3242,I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.,No
3243,He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.,Yes
3244,And the last thing I wanna make is this.,No
3245,He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.,No
3246,We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.,No
3247,"But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.",Yes
3256,"Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.",No
3257,Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.,Yes
3258,"When Mr. Reagan raised this uh - question in Florida uh - Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word ""detente.""",Yes
3259,"I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.",No
3260,"When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone.",No
3261,We retained control as though we had sovereignty.,No
3263,I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.,No
3264,I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.,No
3265,"I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.",No
3267,The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.,No
3268,The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.,No
3269,And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.,No
3270,The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.,Yes
3271,I believe those negotiations should continue.,No
3272,"But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.",No
3273,Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.,No
3274,"On non - nu- oh - uh - nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh - nuclear suppliers.",No
3275,That conference has met six times.,No
3276,"In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.",No
3280,The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.,Yes
3281,"On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.",Yes
3282,I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.,No
3283,But let me comment on the report.,No
3284,"Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.",No
3285,And let me make another observation.,No
3286,"This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.",No
3287,"He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.",Yes
3288,"And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.",No
3291,We did the right thing.,No
3292,It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.,No
3293,Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.,No
3294,We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.,Yes
3295,Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.,No
3296,"But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.",No
3297,And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.,No
3299,"Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.",No
3300,I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.,No
3301,Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.,No
3302,He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.,Yes
3303,I understand that the report today is accurate.,No
3304,"Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.",Yes
3305,I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.,No
3306,"I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.",Yes
3307,"I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.",No
3308,"The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.",No
3309,This is uh - what the American people want.,No
3310,"When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.",No
3311,"But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.",No
3315,I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.,No
3316,This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.,Yes
3317,I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.,No
3318,It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.,No
3319,It's a matter of morality.,No
3320,"And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.",No
3323,And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.,Yes
3325,Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.,No
3326,The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.,Yes
3327,"And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.",Yes
3328,And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.,Yes
3329,Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.,Yes
3330,And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.,Yes
3332,"Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.",No
3333,"This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.",Yes
3336,Let me restate uh - our policy.,No
3337,"As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.",Yes
3338,"If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.",No
3341,"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.",Yes
3342,This is what the families of MIAs want.,No
3343,"So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.",Yes
3344,We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.,Yes
3345,"Several months ago the Vietnam government said, ""We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs.",No
3346,"So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.",No
3347,"I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.",No
3349,"We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.",Yes
3355,"The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.",No
3356,This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.,No
3357,"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?",Yes
3358,"Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?",No
3359,Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?,No
3360,"Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?",No
3361,Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?,No
3362,Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?,No
3363,I believe we can and we ought to.,No
3364,Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.,No
3365,"In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.",No
3366,Our people feel that we've lost something precious.,No
3368,I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.,No
3370,Why can't we have that once again?,No
3371,"We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.",No
3373,We can be once again.,No
3374,"We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.",No
3375,It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.,No
3376,"It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.",No
3378,"As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.",No
3379,"We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.",No
3380,"In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?",No
3386,"Thank you, and good night.",No
3424,I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.,No
3425,"You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.",No
3426,"Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",Yes
3427,"And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.",No
3428,"And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?",No
3430,How's it going to affect my house?,No
3431,How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?,No
3432,"So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.",No
3433,And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.,Yes
3434,"Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.",No
3435,"Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.",No
3437,"And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.",No
3438,"Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.",Yes
3445,And I do have a sad note tonight.,No
3446,Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.,No
3447,He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.,No
3448,Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.,No
3449,I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.,No
3450,"And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately.",No
3451,So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.,No
3452,"But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.",No
3453,"Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.",Yes
3454,And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.,No
3455,And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.,No
3456,"We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.",No
3457,"But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.",Yes
3458,This package has transparency in it.,No
3459,It has to have accountability and oversight.,No
3460,"It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans.",No
3461,We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.,No
3462,"And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.",No
3463,"And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.",No
3464,And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.,Yes
3465,But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.,No
3466,This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.,No
3467,"This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.",No
3468,And we've got a lot of work to do.,No
3469,And we've got to create jobs.,No
3470,"And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",No
3478,We haven't seen the language yet.,No
3479,And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.,No
3480,"So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.",No
3481,"The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?",No
3482,"Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.",Yes
3483,"Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.",Yes
3484,"So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.",No
3485,And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.,No
3486,"But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?",No
3487,We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.,No
3488,And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.,No
3490,I -- I hope so.,No
3496,"But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.",No
3497,A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.,No
3498,But there's also the issue of responsibility.,No
3499,You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.,No
3500,"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.",No
3501,"One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.",Yes
3502,"And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.",No
3503,Somehow we've lost that accountability.,No
3504,I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.,Yes
3505,"We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.",No
3506,"But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.",No
3507,"As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.",No
3508,And I promise you that that will happen.,No
3510,"Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.",No
3511,"I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.",No
3512,And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.,No
3513,"And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",No
3515,I do not think that they are.,No
3517,"Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",No
3523,The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.,No
3524,"And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.",No
3525,They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.,No
3526,We haven't been paying attention to them.,No
3527,"And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.",No
3530,"No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.",No
3531,We've got fundamental problems in the system.,Yes
3532,"And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.",Yes
3533,So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.,No
3534,"And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.",Yes
3535,But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.,No
3536,"And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.",No
3537,"America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.",No
3538,"But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.",No
3543,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.",No
3544,It's completely out of control.,No
3546,"We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.",No
3547,"And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.",No
3548,It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.,No
3549,And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.,Yes
3550,"You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.",Yes
3551,"I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.",Yes
3552,And it has got to be brought under control.,No
3553,"As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.",No
3554,This one's kind of old.,No
3556,I will make them famous.,No
3557,You will know their names.,No
3558,"Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.",No
3559,"He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.",Yes
3560,"I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.",No
3561,"That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",No
3563,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.",Yes
3564,"And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.",Yes
3565,But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.,Yes
3566,"Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.",Yes
3567,"Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.",No
3568,"And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.",Yes
3569,"So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.",No
3570,"What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.",Yes
3571,"And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.",No
3572,"And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.",No
3574,"Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...",No
3577,Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.,Yes
3578,"He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.",No
3580,"But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.",No
3582,Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?,Yes
3585,"That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.",No
3586,It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.,No
3587,I have fought against it my career.,No
3588,I have fought against it.,Yes
3589,"I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.",No
3590,I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.,No
3591,"Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.",Yes
3592,"Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.",No
3593,I want to cut spending.,No
3594,I want to keep taxes low.,No
3596,I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.,No
3598,"What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.",Yes
3599,I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.,No
3600,I think those are pretty important priorities.,No
3601,And I pay for every dime of it.,No
3602,But let's go back to the original point.,No
3603,"John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.",No
3604,"And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.",No
3605,"And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.",No
3606,But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.,No
3607,"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.",Yes
3609,"Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.",No
3610,"Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.",Yes
3612,"Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.",No
3613,I want to cut that business tax.,No
3614,I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.,No
3615,"But, again, I want to return.",No
3616,It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.,Yes
3617,"I can tell you, it's rife.",No
3619,"The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.",No
3622,"And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.",Yes
3623,"So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.",No
3624,"I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.",No
3625,"I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.",No
3626,"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich.""",No
3628,"Well, let me just make a couple of points.",No
3630,My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.,No
3631,"And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.",Yes
3632,"Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.",No
3633,"Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.",Yes
3634,"And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.",Yes
3635,It's not like you want to close the loopholes.,No
3636,You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.,No
3638,"Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.",No
3639,"Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.",Yes
3640,"So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.",No
3641,Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.,Yes
3642,"And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.",No
3643,It is not a good deal for the American people.,No
3644,"But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.",No
3645,"Well, you know, let me just...",No
3648,We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.,No
3649,It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.,No
3650,"It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.",Yes
3651,I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.,Yes
3652,"John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.",Yes
3653,You've got to look at our record.,No
3654,You've got to look at our records.,No
3656,Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?,No
3657,Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?,No
3658,Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?,No
3659,"And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.",Yes
3660,"Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.",No
3661,"And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.",No
3662,"But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.",Yes
3663,"He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.",Yes
3666,And that's just a fact.,Yes
3667,"Again, you can look it up.",No
3668,"Look, it's just not true.",No
3669,"And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.",Yes
3670,"Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.",No
3671,"But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.",No
3673,"With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.",Yes
3674,"No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.",Yes
3675,"We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.",Yes
3680,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.",No
3681,We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.,No
3682,"The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.",Yes
3683,But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.,No
3684,There are some things that I think have to be done.,No
3685,"We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.",No
3686,"We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.",No
3687,Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.,Yes
3688,"They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.",Yes
3689,I'm meeting folks all over the country.,No
3690,"We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.",No
3691,The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.,No
3692,We've got to invest in science and technology.,No
3693,China had a space launch and a space walk.,No
3696,"And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.",No
3697,"Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.",No
3699,We can't shortchange those things.,No
3700,"We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",No
3702,"Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.",No
3703,"We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.",No
3704,Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.,Yes
3705,It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.,No
3706,"The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.",No
3707,"First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.",No
3709,"I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.",No
3710,We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.,Yes
3711,"We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.",Yes
3712,So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.,No
3713,"We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.",No
3714,I know how to do that.,No
3715,I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.,Yes
3716,"And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.",Yes
3717,But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.,No
3721,"As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...",No
3724,"Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.",No
3725,That is a big project.,No
3726,That is a multi-year project.,Yes
3728,Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.,No
3729,But John is right we have to make cuts.,No
3730,We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.,Yes
3731,Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.,No
3732,They just skim off $15 billion.,Yes
3733,That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.,No
3734,They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.,Yes
3735,Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.,No
3736,"Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.",Yes
3742,"How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.",No
3744,I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.,No
3746,The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.,No
3747,There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.,No
3748,"I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.",No
3749,Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.,No
3750,We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.,Yes
3751,"It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",No
3753,Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.,Yes
3754,"We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.",No
3755,Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.,Yes
3756,"You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.",No
3757,Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.,No
3758,"An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.",No
3763,There's no doubt itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna affect our budgets.,No
3764,There is no doubt about it.,No
3765,"Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.",Yes
3766,"If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.",No
3767,"And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.",Yes
3768,"The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.",No
3769,"Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.",No
3770,I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.,No
3773,We have to obviously cut spending.,No
3774,I have fought to cut spending.,Yes
3775,Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.,Yes
3776,I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.,No
3777,"We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.",No
3778,And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.,No
3779,"And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.",No
3780,We owe China $500 billion.,Yes
3781,"And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.",No
3782,And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.,No
3783,"I just want to make this point, Jim.",No
3784,"John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.",Yes
3785,This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.,Yes
3786,"So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.",Yes
3788,It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.,No
3789,"I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.",Yes
3790,On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.,No
3791,I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.,No
3797,I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.,No
3798,"Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.",No
3799,And then the war was very badly mishandled.,No
3800,"I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.",No
3801,"This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.",No
3802,"And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.",No
3804,And we are winning in Iraq.,Yes
3805,And we will come home with victory and with honor.,No
3806,And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.,No
3807,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.",No
3808,The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.,No
3809,It would have been increase in sectarian violence.,No
3810,"It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.",No
3811,So there was a lot at stake there.,No
3812,"And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.",No
3813,"And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.",No
3814,And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.,No
3816,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.",No
3817,"Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.",Yes
3818,We hadn't caught bin Laden.,Yes
3819,"We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.",No
3820,Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.,No
3821,"And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.",No
3822,"We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.",Yes
3823,"We have lost over 4,000 lives.",Yes
3824,"We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.",Yes
3825,We took our eye off the ball.,No
3826,"And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.",Yes
3827,"So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.",No
3828,But we have to use our military wisely.,No
3829,And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.,No
3831,The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.,No
3832,"The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.",No
3833,That's the decision of the next president of the United States.,No
3834,"Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.",Yes
3835,"Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.",No
3836,"But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.",Yes
3837,"Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.",Yes
3839,Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.,No
3840,"To this day, he has never had a hearing.",Yes
3846,He raised a whole bunch of them.,No
3849,"Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.",No
3850,But that's Senate inside baseball.,No
3851,But let's get back to the core issue here.,No
3852,Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.,No
3853,"They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.",No
3854,"But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.",No
3855,"And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.",No
3856,You talk about the surge.,No
3857,"The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.",No
3858,You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.,Yes
3860,You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.,No
3862,You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.,No
3864,And so my question is...,No
3867,"... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.",No
3869,I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.,No
3870,"But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.",No
3871,"General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.",No
3872,I was honored to be there.,No
3873,I was honored to speak to those troops.,No
3874,"And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.",No
3875,And you know what they said to us?,No
3876,"They said, let us win.",No
3877,"They said, let us win.",No
3878,We don't want our kids coming back here.,No
3879,"And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.",No
3880,Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.,No
3882,They just passed an electoral...,No
3884,An election law just in the last few days.,No
3885,"There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.",No
3886,They inform on the bad guys.,No
3887,"And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.",No
3888,"That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.",No
3890,"Jim, Jim, this is a big...",No
3892,And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.,No
3893,"And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",Yes
3894,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.",No
3895,"First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.",No
3897,"I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.",Yes
3898,We had a difference on the timetable.,Yes
3899,We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.,Yes
3900,"We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.",No
3901,And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.,No
3902,"The question is, was this wise?",No
3903,"We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.",No
3904,We need more troops there.,No
3905,We need more resources there.,No
3906,"Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?",No
3907,We've been successful in Afghanistan.,No
3908,There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.,No
3909,"This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.",No
3910,Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.,Yes
3911,But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.,No
3912,"Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.",No
3913,We should do it in phases.,No
3914,"But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.",No
3915,"And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",Yes
3916,Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.,No
3919,What he said was a precipitous...,No
3920,That's what Admiral Mullen said.,No
3921,... withdrawal would be dangerous.,No
3922,He did not say that.,No
3924,And also General Petraeus said the same thing.,No
3925,"Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.",No
3926,"Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.",Yes
3927,And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.,No
3928,"It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed.",No
3929,"But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.",No
3935,"Yes, I think we need more troops.",No
3936,I've been saying that for over a year now.,Yes
3937,"And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.",Yes
3938,We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.,Yes
3939,And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.,Yes
3941,"And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.",No
3942,So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.,No
3943,"Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.",Yes
3944,"And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.",Yes
3945,"So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.",No
3946,It's not just more troops.,No
3947,We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.,No
3948,And I've said this to President Karzai.,No
3949,"Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.",Yes
3950,"Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.",Yes
3951,"And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",No
3953,"First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.",Yes
3954,"And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.",No
3955,So we can't ignore those lessons of history.,No
3956,"Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.",No
3957,I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.,No
3958,"So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.",Yes
3959,We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.,No
3960,He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.,Yes
3961,"Now, you don't do that.",No
3962,You don't say that out loud.,No
3963,"If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.",No
3964,"Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.",No
3965,And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.,Yes
3967,I can see how tough that terrain is.,No
3968,It's ruled by a handful of tribes.,No
3969,"And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.",Yes
3970,It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.,No
3971,And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.,No
3972,And it's going to be tough.,No
3973,They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.,Yes
3974,And it's going to be tough.,No
3976,And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.,Yes
3977,So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.,No
3978,"But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.",Yes
3979,So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.,No
3980,It's a strategy that will succeed.,No
3981,And Pakistan is a very important element in this.,No
3982,And I know how to work with them.,No
3983,And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.,No
3984,Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.,No
3986,"And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.",No
3987,"Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.",No
3988,"And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.",No
3989,"But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.",No
3990,I think this is the right strategy.,No
3991,"Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.",No
3992,This is not an easy situation.,No
3993,You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.,Yes
3994,And we've got a choice.,No
3995,"We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.",No
3996,"And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.",Yes
3997,"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.""",No
3998,"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.",Yes
4000,"And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.",Yes
4001,That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.,No
4002,I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.,Yes
4003,"Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.",No
4004,"But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.",No
4005,"Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.",Yes
4006,"And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.",Yes
4007,"Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.",Yes
4008,And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.,No
4009,I supported -- I supported that.,Yes
4010,"I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.",Yes
4011,"That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.",No
4012,I supported what we did in Kosovo.,Yes
4013,I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.,No
4014,"And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.",Yes
4015,So I have a record.,No
4016,"I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.",Yes
4017,"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.""",No
4018,"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.",No
4019,"This was last August, a year ago.",No
4020,"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.""",No
4021,"And this was August, a year ago.",No
4022,"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain.""",No
4023,"That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.",No
4024,And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.,No
4025,I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.,No
4026,"A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.",No
4027,And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.,No
4028,And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.,No
4029,"Jim, let me just make a point.",No
4030,"I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.",No
4031,"She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.",No
4032,No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.,No
4033,And we honor all the service that they've provided.,No
4034,Our troops have performed brilliantly.,No
4035,"The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.",No
4036,"And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.",No
4037,And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.,No
4038,"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan.",Yes
4039,You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.,No
4040,You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.,No
4041,I think that is something we have to take seriously.,No
4042,"And when I'm president, I will.",No
4044,"You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.",No
4045,"By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.",No
4046,But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.,No
4047,I know what our needs are.,No
4048,"So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.",No
4049,"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.",Yes
4050,Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.,No
4053,"A testimony to you, Jim.",No
4059,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.",No
4060,Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.,No
4061,Let's just make that very clear.,No
4062,"What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.",No
4063,The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.,Yes
4064,"I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.",No
4065,"We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.",No
4066,"The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.",No
4067,"So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.",No
4068,"But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.",No
4069,And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.,No
4070,"What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.",Yes
4071,"There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.",Yes
4072,Senator Obama said that would be provocative.,No
4073,So this is a serious threat.,No
4074,"This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",No
4076,"Well, let me just correct something very quickly.",No
4077,I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.,No
4079,What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.,No
4081,"And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.",No
4082,Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.,No
4084,And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.,No
4085,"They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.",Yes
4086,"So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.",No
4087,"Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.",No
4088,It would be a game changer.,No
4089,"Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.",No
4090,Now here's what we need to do.,No
4091,We do need tougher sanctions.,No
4092,"I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.",No
4093,"But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.",No
4094,"It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.",No
4095,"In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.",Yes
4096,That will change when I'm president of the United States.,No
4098,"Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.",Yes
4100,"Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.",Yes
4101,"The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.",No
4102,"Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.",No
4103,"Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.",No
4104,"Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.",No
4105,"Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.",No
4106,So let's talk about this.,No
4107,"First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.",No
4108,So he may not be the right person to talk to.,No
4109,"But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.",No
4110,"And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",No
4111,"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.",Yes
4112,This is one of your own advisers.,No
4113,"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions.""",No
4114,It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.,No
4115,"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you.""",No
4116,There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.,No
4117,"Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.",No
4118,But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.,No
4120,"President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.",Yes
4121,"Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.",No
4122,"And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.",No
4123,They're a member of the axis of evil.,No
4124,We can't deal with them.,No
4125,And you know what happened?,No
4126,They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.,Yes
4129,They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.,No
4130,"And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.",Yes
4131,"When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.",Yes
4132,"And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.",No
4133,"He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.",Yes
4135,Spain is a NATO ally.,No
4137,"If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.",No
4138,I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.,No
4139,I don't even have a seal yet.,No
4140,"Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.",No
4141,He did not say that.,No
4143,He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.,Yes
4145,The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.,No
4146,"What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a ""stinking corpse,"" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.",No
4148,It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.,No
4149,And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.,No
4150,"As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.",No
4151,"By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.",No
4152,"The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.",Yes
4153,"We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.",Yes
4154,"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous.",No
4155,"Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.",No
4156,"Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.",No
4157,This is a mischaracterization of my position.,No
4158,When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.,No
4159,"And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.",No
4160,And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.,No
4161,Nobody is even talking about that.,No
4162,So let me get this right.,No
4163,"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?",No
4167,"By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.",No
4168,I've known him for 35 years.,No
4169,We will take a look.,No
4170,And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.,No
4172,"Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.",No
4173,We do that all the time.,No
4176,And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.,No
4177,I am not parsing words.,No
4178,"He's parsing words, my friends.",No
4179,I'm using the same words that your advisers use.,No
4187,"Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.",No
4188,Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.,No
4190,"And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.",No
4191,They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.,No
4192,"It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.",No
4193,"And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.",No
4194,They are members of NATO.,Yes
4195,"And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.",Yes
4196,"Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.",No
4197,It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.,No
4199,"They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.",Yes
4200,"This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.",Yes
4201,That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.,No
4203,"You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?",No
4204,And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.,No
4206,"Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.",No
4207,"His first statement was, ""Both sides ought to show restraint.""",No
4208,"Again, a little bit of naivete there.",No
4209,He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.,Yes
4210,And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.,Yes
4211,"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B.""",No
4212,And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.,No
4213,I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.,No
4214,I am sure that that will not happen.,No
4215,But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.,No
4216,And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.,No
4217,It had everything to do with energy.,No
4218,There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey.,No
4219,"And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.",Yes
4220,"It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",No
4221,"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.",No
4222,"Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.",No
4223,We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.,No
4224,They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.,Yes
4225,"By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.",No
4226,And this is -- this is Georgian territory.,No
4227,"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president.""",No
4228,"It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.",No
4229,They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.,No
4230,"So, this is a very difficult situation.",No
4231,We want to work with the Russians.,No
4232,But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.,No
4234,"This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.",No
4235,And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.,No
4236,"So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.",No
4238,"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.",No
4239,"Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.",Yes
4240,I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.,Yes
4241,"And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.",Yes
4242,Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.,Yes
4243,Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.,No
4244,Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.,No
4245,"So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.",No
4246,That made no sense whatsoever.,No
4247,And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.,No
4249,"But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.",No
4251,"Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.",Yes
4252,"That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.",No
4253,"And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",Yes
4254,So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.,No
4255,"What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.",No
4256,"And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.",No
4257,"And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.",No
4258,"Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.",Yes
4259,"And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.",No
4265,No one from Arizona is against solar.,Yes
4266,"And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.",Yes
4268,"That's just not true, John.",No
4269,"John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.",No
4270,... it's hard to get there from here.,No
4271,And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.,No
4272,"And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.",No
4273,"And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.",No
4274,"I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.",No
4279,I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.,Yes
4280,That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.,No
4281,I -- I just have to correct the record here.,No
4282,I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.,Yes
4283,What I've said is that we have to store it safely.,No
4284,"And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.",No
4286,"I've got to make this point, Jim.",No
4289,I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...,No
4290,He -- he -- he objects...,No
4295,No one can be opposed to alternate energy.,No
4298,You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.,No
4303,I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.,No
4304,"I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.",No
4305,"And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.",No
4306,"I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.",Yes
4307,"But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.",Yes
4308,"And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.",Yes
4309,"And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.",Yes
4310,"And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.",No
4311,And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.,Yes
4312,"I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.",No
4313,So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.,No
4314,We have to do a better job in human intelligence.,No
4315,And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.,No
4316,We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.,No
4317,We have to work more closely with our allies.,No
4318,"I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.",No
4319,But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.,No
4320,But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.,No
4321,"And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.",Yes
4322,And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.,No
4323,"But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",No
4325,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.",No
4326,"Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.",Yes
4327,"We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.",No
4328,We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.,No
4329,We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.,No
4330,And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.,No
4332,This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.,No
4333,It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.,No
4334,And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.,Yes
4335,"And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.",Yes
4337,They are now operating in 60 countries.,Yes
4338,We can't simply be focused on Iraq.,No
4339,"We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.",No
4340,That's going to be critical.,No
4341,We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.,No
4342,And one last point I want to make.,No
4343,"It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.",No
4344,And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.,No
4345,We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.,No
4346,And this is the greatest country on Earth.,No
4347,"But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",Yes
4350,"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven.""",Yes
4351,"That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.",Yes
4352,And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.,No
4353,We seem to come full circle again.,No
4354,"Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.",No
4355,They would establish a base in Iraq.,No
4356,"The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.",No
4357,"All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.",No
4358,"And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.",Yes
4359,And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.,No
4360,That is the central issue of our time.,No
4361,And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.,No
4364,"Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.",Yes
4365,That has been their priority.,No
4366,That has been where all our resources have gone.,Yes
4367,"In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.",No
4371,"In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.",Yes
4372,They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.,Yes
4373,"And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.",Yes
4374,"They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.",No
4375,"We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.",No
4376,We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.,Yes
4377,And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.,No
4378,"We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.",No
4379,There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.,Yes
4380,So this is a national security issue.,No
4381,We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.,Yes
4382,"I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, ""How can I get disability payments?",No
4383,"I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment.""",No
4384,"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.",No
4385,What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.,No
4386,That's been missing over the last eight years.,No
4388,"I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.",Yes
4389,"There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.",No
4391,"As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.",No
4394,And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.,No
4396,And I'll take care of them.,No
4397,And they know that I'll take care of them.,No
4399,"But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.",No
4400,"Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.",No
4402,I'm ready to go at it right now.,No
4403,"Well, let me just make a closing point.",No
4404,"You know, my father came from Kenya.",No
4405,That's where I get my name.,No
4406,"And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.",No
4407,The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.,No
4408,"I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.",No
4409,"And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.",No
4410,And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.,No
4413,"Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.",No
4414,"And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.",Yes
4415,"I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.",No
5489,"And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.",No
5490,"It's good to see you again, Senator Obama.",No
5492,"They're hurting, and they're angry.",No
5494,And they want this country to go in a new direction.,No
5495,And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.,No
5497,Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.,No
5499,"I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.",No
5500,"Now, we have allocated $750 billion.",Yes
5501,"Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.",No
5504,That paid their mortgage payments?,No
5505,It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.,No
5507,We ought to put the homeowners first.,No
5508,And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.,No
5511,"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.",No
5513,And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.,No
5514,And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.,Yes
5515,Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.,No
5516,And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.,No
5517,But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.,No
5518,Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.,No
5519,So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.,No
5520,"Number one, let's focus on jobs.",No
5521,I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.,No
5522,"Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.",No
5523,Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.,No
5524,That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.,Yes
5525,"I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.",Yes
5526,And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.,No
5529,We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.,No
5530,We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.,No
5531,We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.,No
5535,"I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.",No
5536,"Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.",No
5537,And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.,No
5538,"You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.",No
5539,"Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.",No
5543,That's 16 million jobs in America.,Yes
5544,And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.,No
5547,He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.,No
5548,Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.,No
5549,I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.,No
5550,"And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.",Yes
5551,"Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.",Yes
5554,"If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.",Yes
5556,"And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.",Yes
5557,"In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.",Yes
5558,"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.""",No
5560,And that requires us to make some important choices.,No
5561,The last point I'll make about small businesses.,No
5563,They produce the most jobs.,Yes
5564,"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.",No
5566,I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.,No
5567,You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.,No
5568,"The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.",Yes
5569,"I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.",Yes
5574,We're not going to do that in my administration.,No
5575,If I can answer the question.,No
5576,"Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.",Yes
5578,We're talking about Joe the plumber.,No
5579,"... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.",No
5580,"Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.",Yes
5581,"So, look, nobody likes taxes.",No
5585,Let's not raise anybody's taxes.,No
5588,The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.,Yes
5591,Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?,No
5593,We need to encourage business.,No
5610,"Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.",Yes
5611,I haven't made a promise about...,No
5615,"What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.",Yes
5616,"Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.",Yes
5617,"And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.",Yes
5618,It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.,No
5619,It's not improving our health care system.,No
5621,We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.,No
5623,"Programs that we need, we should make them work better.",No
5624,"Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.",No
5626,"If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.",Yes
5627,"If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.",No
5628,"If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.",No
5629,"But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.",No
5634,I just want to get back to this home ownership.,No
5636,And they went out and bought up these mortgages.,Yes
5637,"And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.",Yes
5638,"And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.",Yes
5639,"So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.",No
5645,We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.,No
5646,"It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.",Yes
5647,And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.,No
5649,"I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK?",No
5650,Some people say that's a hatchet.,No
5651,"That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?",No
5652,Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country.,No
5653,We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.,Yes
5656,I know how to eliminate programs.,No
5658,"I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.",Yes
5659,Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.,No
5660,I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.,Yes
5661,I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.,No
5662,I know how to save billions.,No
5663,"I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.",Yes
5664,"But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.",No
5667,... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.,Yes
5668,That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.,No
5670,"Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.",No
5674,"And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.",No
5675,There are some programs that are underfunded.,No
5677,"Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.",No
5678,That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.,No
5679,Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.,Yes
5680,"There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.",No
5681,But it's not going to solve the problem.,No
5682,"Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.",No
5684,It has doubled over the last eight years.,Yes
5686,So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.,No
5687,"And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.",Yes
5688,"We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.",No
5695,"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.",No
5696,"If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.",No
5697,I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.,No
5698,Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets.,Yes
5700,"Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.",No
5701,It's completely out of control.,No
5702,"The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.",Yes
5703,They're doing it all over America because they have to.,Yes
5704,Because they have to balance their budgets.,No
5705,I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...,No
5707,... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.,No
5708,"Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.",No
5709,I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.,No
5710,Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.,Yes
5712,He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed.,Yes
5714,Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.,No
5715,I have fought against spending.,Yes
5716,I have fought against special interests.,Yes
5717,I have fought for reform.,No
5718,You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.,No
5720,"Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.",No
5721,"First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.",Yes
5724,I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.,Yes
5725,Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.,No
5726,I support clean coal technology.,No
5727,Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists.,No
5728,So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.,No
5729,"Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.",Yes
5730,"Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.",Yes
5731,"So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.",Yes
5732,"Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.",No
5733,"But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.",No
5735,And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.,No
5741,But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.,No
5742,I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.,No
5743,I've got the scars to prove it.,No
5744,Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.,No
5745,"Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.",Yes
5746,"Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation.",No
5747,Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.,No
5748,Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.,No
5749,I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.,Yes
5751,"Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.",No
5760,"Well, this has been a tough campaign.",No
5761,It's been a very tough campaign.,No
5762,"And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.",No
5763,"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas.",No
5765,"And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.",No
5766,And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.,No
5767,But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.,No
5768,"One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.",Yes
5769,"That, to me, was so hurtful.",No
5770,"And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.",Yes
5771,"Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.",Yes
5772,"I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.",No
5775,And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.,Yes
5776,And I can prove it.,No
5777,"And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.",No
5785,"And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.",Yes
5789,"And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.",No
5790,That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.,No
5791,"The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.",No
5792,"What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.",No
5793,And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.,No
5794,"Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.",Yes
5795,"And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.",No
5796,And that is something that I would welcome.,No
5797,"But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.",No
5798,"Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.",No
5800,Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan.,No
5801,And any objective observer has said it's not true.,No
5802,You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research.,Yes
5804,You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.,No
5805,"So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.",Yes
5806,"And of course, I've been talking about the economy.",No
5807,"Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.",No
5808,I'm going to let him keep his wealth.,No
5809,"And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.",No
5810,That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.,No
5811,"But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...",No
5812,"I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.""",No
5813,And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.,No
5817,You've got to read what he said.,No
5818,Let me -- let me complete...,No
5821,"I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.",No
5822,"And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.",Yes
5824,"And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.",No
5826,"We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...",No
5828,... talking about it this evening.,No
5832,"Well, let me just say I would...",No
5834,Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies.,No
5835,"Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.",No
5837,And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.,No
5838,"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens.",No
5839,"And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.",No
5840,"In fact, some T-shirts that are very...",No
5843,"So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.",Yes
5844,But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.,No
5846,"Well, look, Bob, as I said...",No
5848,"You know, here's what I would say.",No
5850,I suspect we won't agree here tonight.,No
5851,"What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.",No
5852,And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.,No
5853,"And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.",No
5854,"What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.",No
5855,And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.,No
5857,"Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.",No
5861,"But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.",No
5862,"We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.",Yes
5867,"Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.",No
5868,"In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.",No
5869,This has been their primary focus.,Yes
5870,So let's get the record straight.,No
5872,"Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.",Yes
5873,I have roundly condemned those acts.,Yes
5874,"Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.",Yes
5875,"Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.",No
5876,Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.,No
5877,He has never been involved in this campaign.,No
5878,And he will not advise me in the White House.,No
5880,"Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.",No
5881,"Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.",Yes
5882,It had nothing to do with us.,Yes
5884,The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.,No
5885,"Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.",No
5887,"On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.",No
5888,"If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.",No
5889,"Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.",No
5890,"And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.",No
5891,"Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.",Yes
5892,So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.,No
5895,And that's not the facts.,No
5896,"And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.",Yes
5897,It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.,No
5898,"And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.",No
5899,And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.,No
5900,And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.,No
5908,It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.,No
5909,"And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.",No
5910,"But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.",No
5911,"And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.",No
5912,That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.,Yes
5913,"That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.",Yes
5914,"Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.",No
5915,"Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.",No
5916,"So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.",No
5918,"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.",No
5919,They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.,No
5921,She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor.,Yes
5922,"When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, ""This can't go on.""",Yes
5923,She's given money back to the taxpayers.,Yes
5924,She's cut the size of government.,Yes
5925,"She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.",Yes
5926,She's a reformer through and through.,No
5927,And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.,No
5930,"And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.",No
5931,"She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.",Yes
5932,She understands that better than almost any American that I know.,No
5934,And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.,No
5935,And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.,No
5938,"You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.",No
5939,"I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.",No
5940,And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.,No
5943,That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.,No
5944,"And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.",No
5945,"That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.",No
5950,"He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.",Yes
5951,"In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.",Yes
5952,"We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.",No
5953,We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.,No
5954,"There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.",No
5955,"But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, ""We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer"" -- why do we always have to spend more?",No
5956,"Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?",No
5957,Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.,Yes
5968,"I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.",No
5970,"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.""",Yes
5971,You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.,No
5972,"We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.",No
5973,We can store and we can reprocess.,No
5976,"We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.",No
5977,"So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.",No
5978,"So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.",No
5981,"I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.",No
5982,I think that's about a realistic timeframe.,No
5983,And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.,No
5984,"Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.",No
5985,But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.,Yes
5986,It's mortgaging our children's future.,No
5987,"Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.",No
5988,"Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",Yes
5989,And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.,No
5991,"That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.",Yes
5992,"These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.",No
5994,Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.,Yes
5995,I believe in free trade.,No
5997,And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.,Yes
5998,And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.,No
5999,In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.,No
6003,That is not free trade.,No
6007,And you really have to pay attention to words.,No
6008,"He said, we will look at offshore drilling.",Yes
6011,We can offshore drill now.,Yes
6012,We've got to do it now.,No
6013,We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.,No
6015,The technology is there and we have to drill now.,No
6017,I am a free trader.,Yes
6018,"And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.",No
6020,"Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.",Yes
6021,"Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.",Yes
6023,The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.,Yes
6024,And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.,No
6025,Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.,No
6026,But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.,No
6028,"Actually, I understand it pretty well.",No
6029,The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.,Yes
6030,"And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.",Yes
6031,But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.,No
6032,"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",No
6033,"When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.",No
6034,They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.,Yes
6035,"And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.",Yes
6036,"That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.",No
6037,And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.,No
6038,It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.,Yes
6039,"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",No
6040,"Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.",Yes
6041,"Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.",Yes
6042,So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.,No
6043,"And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.",Yes
6044,We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.,No
6048,"We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.",Yes
6051,"Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.",No
6052,Neither of them have health insurance.,No
6053,"And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.",No
6054,So here's what my plan does.,No
6055,"If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.",No
6056,"If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.",Yes
6058,"And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.",Yes
6059,"If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.",No
6060,We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.,No
6061,We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.,No
6062,We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.,No
6063,"And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.",No
6065,"This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.",No
6068,"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.",No
6069,"They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.",Yes
6070,Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.,Yes
6071,"And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.",No
6076,That will -- that will reduce costs.,No
6077,We need to have more community health centers.,No
6078,We need to have walk-in clinics.,No
6081,Every parent should know what's going on there.,No
6082,We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.,No
6083,"But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.",No
6084,Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.,No
6085,"Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.",No
6086,"Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.",Yes
6088,"Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.",Yes
6089,"If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.",No
6092,It is not and I just described it...,No
6096,I just described what my plan is.,No
6097,"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.",No
6098,Here's your fine -- zero.,No
6099,"You won't pay a fine, because...",No
6101,"Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.",No
6102,I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.,Yes
6103,"But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.",No
6104,Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.,No
6105,"Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.",Yes
6106,The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.,Yes
6109,"In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.",No
6110,"If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.",No
6111,"Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.",No
6112,"He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.",Yes
6114,And you can go out and buy your own insurance.,No
6115,"Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.",Yes
6116,"This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.",Yes
6117,"Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.",No
6118,"And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.",Yes
6119,"And this is your plan, John.",No
6122,"So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.",No
6123,"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.",No
6124,"That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.",No
6126,"Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.",No
6127,"Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.",Yes
6128,That's big government at its best.,No
6129,"Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.",No
6130,And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.,No
6134,"This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.",No
6136,"If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.",Yes
6137,Senator Obama wants government to do the job.,No
6140,I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.,No
6142,And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.,Yes
6143,"We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.",No
6144,"Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.",No
6148,You all just heard my plan.,No
6149,"If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.",No
6150,"Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.",Yes
6151,That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.,No
6153,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.",Yes
6163,I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.,Yes
6166,I thought it was a bad decision.,No
6167,I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.,No
6170,And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.,No
6171,"Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.",Yes
6172,Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.,Yes
6173,"We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.",No
6174,You were offered a chance to join.,No
6175,"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges.""",No
6176,I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.,Yes
6180,That's not the way we should judge these nominees.,No
6182,They should be judged on their qualifications.,No
6184,I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.,No
6185,And not legislating from the bench.,No
6188,I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.,No
6189,But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.,No
6191,"Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.",No
6193,It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.,No
6195,But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.,No
6197,"But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.",No
6198,"And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.",No
6199,So this is going to be an important issue.,No
6200,"I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.",No
6201,I'll just give you one quick example.,No
6202,Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.,Yes
6203,"For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.",Yes
6204,"And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.",Yes
6205,We tried to overturn it in the Senate.,No
6206,I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.,Yes
6207,"I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.",No
6208,And that's the kind of judge that I want.,No
6210,"Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.",Yes
6211,It was a trial lawyer's dream.,No
6212,Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.,No
6218,"And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.",No
6220,"And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.",Yes
6221,"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that.",No
6222,I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.,No
6223,"And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.",No
6224,"And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.",No
6225,"It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.",No
6228,"If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.",No
6229,The -- here are the facts.,No
6230,There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.,Yes
6231,"The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.",Yes
6232,"And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.",Yes
6233,"Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.",Yes
6234,"With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.",No
6235,"And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.",No
6236,"And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.",Yes
6237,The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.,No
6238,"This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.",No
6239,"And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.",No
6240,"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.""",No
6241,"Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.",No
6242,I think it's always a tragic situation.,No
6248,He's health for the mother.,No
6249,"You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.",No
6250,"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health.""",No
6251,"But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.",No
6252,We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.,No
6253,We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.,No
6254,But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.,No
6255,"Of course, we have to come together.",No
6256,"Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.",No
6264,"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.",No
6265,So we've got to get our education system right.,No
6266,"Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.",No
6267,"In some cases, we are going to have to invest.",No
6268,"Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.",No
6269,"I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.",No
6270,And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.,No
6271,"Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.",Yes
6272,"And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.",Yes
6274,"But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.",No
6275,We can't do it just in the schools.,No
6277,"They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.",No
6279,"Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.",No
6280,There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.,No
6281,But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?,No
6282,"So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.",Yes
6283,And we find bad teachers another line of work.,No
6284,"And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.",No
6285,"Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.",No
6286,They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.,Yes
6288,You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.,Yes
6290,"We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.",No
6293,We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.,No
6294,We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.,No
6295,And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.,No
6298,"Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.",No
6299,But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.,No
6300,Now we tried to do this under President Bush.,Yes
6301,He put forward No Child Left Behind.,Yes
6302,"Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.",No
6303,"And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.",Yes
6304,"So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.",No
6305,Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.,No
6306,"Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.",Yes
6308,"And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.",No
6309,Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.,No
6310,And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.,No
6311,"Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.",Yes
6312,"I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.",No
6313,And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.,No
6314,We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.,No
6315,"And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.",No
6316,It's not going to happen on its own.,No
6319,"I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.",Yes
6320,Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.,No
6321,And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.,No
6322,"And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.",No
6324,"That was vouchers, Senator Obama.",No
6325,And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.,No
6326,"Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.",No
6327,"It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.",No
6329,We need to sit down and reauthorize it.,No
6330,"But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.",No
6332,"A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.",No
6333,By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.,Yes
6335,Let's reform it and fund it.,No
6336,"That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.",No
6337,We need to reform these programs.,No
6339,We need to have rewards.,No
6340,It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.,No
6341,"And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.",No
6342,Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.,No
6343,"And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.",No
6345,And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.,No
6346,"But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.",Yes
6347,"And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed.",No
6348,But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.,No
6349,"And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.",No
6352,"Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.",No
6353,And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...,No
6355,"... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.",No
6357,"But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.",Yes
6358,That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.,Yes
6359,"So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.",No
6360,And that's what I intend to do as president.,No
6362,"Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working.",Yes
6368,"Well, thank you again, Bob.",No
6370,And it's great to be with you again.,No
6371,I think we've had a very healthy discussion.,No
6372,"My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.",No
6373,And they were graphically demonstrated again today.,No
6374,America needs a new direction.,No
6375,We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.,No
6376,"I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.",Yes
6377,And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.,No
6378,We have to make health care affordable and available.,No
6379,"We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.",No
6380,We have to stop the spending.,No
6381,"We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.",No
6382,"All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.",No
6383,"That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.",No
6384,I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.,No
6385,"ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.",No
6386,And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.,No
6387,I'd be honored and humbled.,No
6389,"Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.",No
6390,I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.,No
6391,The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.,Yes
6393,"We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.",No
6394,"You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.",No
6395,You've shared your stories with me.,No
6396,And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.,No
6397,And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.,No
6398,"But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.",No
6400,In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.,No
6401,These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.,No
6404,It's not going to be quick.,No
6405,"It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.",No
6407,"I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.",No
6450,"Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.",No
6451,And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task.,No
6452,We're proud to be here.,No
6453,"Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.",No
6454,Will we ever be safe and secure again?,No
6458,"Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.",No
6459,"I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.",No
6460,"And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.",No
6461,The measurement is not: Are we safer?,No
6462,The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?,No
6463,"And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.",No
6464,Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.,Yes
6466,"People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.",Yes
6468,Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.,No
6469,Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.,Yes
6470,So we can do a better job of homeland security.,No
6471,"I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.",No
6472,"I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.",No
6473,We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.,No
6474,"But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.",No
6476,"Bob, thank you very much.",No
6477,I want to thank Arizona State as well.,No
6478,"Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.",No
6479,"I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.",Yes
6480,"As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.",No
6481,And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.,Yes
6484,We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.,No
6485,"In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.",No
6486,"My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.",No
6487,I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.,No
6488,I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.,No
6489,"At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.",No
6490,I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.,Yes
6491,My opponent voted against it.,Yes
6492,We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.,No
6493,But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.,No
6494,"It just takes good, strong leadership.",No
6497,"When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.",Yes
6498,"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """,No
6499,"He said, ""I don't know.",No
6500,I don't really think about him very much.,No
6501,"I'm not that concerned. """,No
6502,We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.,No
6504,"Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.",Yes
6505,It's kind of one of those exaggerations.,No
6506,Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.,No
6507,We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.,No
6508,We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.,No
6509,My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.,No
6510,"No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.",No
6516,"Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.",Yes
6517,And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.,Yes
6518,We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.,No
6519,"My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.",No
6520,"Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.",No
6521,"The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.",No
6522,"I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.",No
6523,We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America.,Yes
6524,"Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.",Yes
6525,One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.,No
6526,"But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.",No
6528,This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system.,No
6529,It's not working for the American family.,No
6530,And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.,No
6531,Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.,Yes
6532,"You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.",Yes
6533,"82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch.",Yes
6534,"223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.",Yes
6535,"All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.",Yes
6536,This president has turned his back on the wellness of America.,No
6537,And there is no system.,No
6538,"In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.",No
6539,Children across our country don't have health care.,No
6540,"We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.",Yes
6541,I have a plan to cover all Americans.,No
6543,We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.,No
6547,"I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.",No
6548,He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get.,No
6549,"That costs the government $7,700 per family.",Yes
6550,"If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.",No
6552,It's called bait and switch.,No
6555,"Actually, it's not an empty promise.",No
6556,"It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan.",Yes
6557,"He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.",No
6558,What we do is we have choice.,No
6559,I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.,No
6560,"Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.",No
6561,"But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.",No
6562,Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.,No
6563,We're not giving this away for nothing.,No
6571,"I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.",No
6572,"During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.",No
6573,"If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.",No
6574,President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.,Yes
6575,He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.,Yes
6576,He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.,Yes
6577,"Now, I'm going to reverse that.",No
6578,I'm going to change that.,No
6579,We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.,No
6580,"Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.",Yes
6581,"And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.",Yes
6582,We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.,Yes
6583,"They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.",Yes
6585,And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound.,No
6586,"I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.",No
6587,I have a manufacturing jobs credit.,No
6588,We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.,No
6589,We raise the student loans.,No
6590,I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.,No
6591,This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.,Yes
6593,"Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.",Yes
6594,He been a senator for 20 years.,No
6595,He voted to increase taxes 98 times.,Yes
6597,"He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.",Yes
6599,"I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.",No
6600,"He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.",Yes
6601,There is a tax gap.,Yes
6602,And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?,No
6604,"I propose a detailed budget, Bob.",No
6605,"I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.",No
6606,It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.,No
6612,"I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.",No
6613,And here's some help for you to go get an education.,No
6614,Here's some help for you to go to a community college.,No
6615,We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.,Yes
6616,We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.,No
6617,"You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.",No
6618,We talk about fiscal matters.,No
6619,But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.,No
6620,I went to Washington to solve problems.,No
6621,And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.,No
6622,"They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.",No
6623,And so we said: Let's raise the standards.,No
6624,"We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.",No
6625,"No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.",No
6626,Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.,No
6627,"Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.",No
6628,"And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.",No
6629,And that's what I would say to that person.,No
6631,I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.,No
6632,"Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.",No
6633,Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.,No
6635,This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.,Yes
6636,Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.,Yes
6638,The wages of Americans have gone down.,Yes
6639,"The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.",Yes
6640,And the president just walks on by this problem.,No
6641,The fact is that he's cut job-training money.,Yes
6643,They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.,Yes
6644,They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.,Yes
6645,They've cut the training money.,Yes
6646,They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.,Yes
6647,"I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.",No
6654,I don't blame them entirely for it.,No
6655,I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.,No
6656,Outsourcing is going to happen.,No
6657,I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.,Yes
6659,"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """,No
6660,"What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.",No
6661,"Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.",No
6662,You get to defer your taxes.,Yes
6663,"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """,No
6666,"And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.",No
6668,The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.,No
6669,This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.,Yes
6670,He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.,No
6671,The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.,Yes
6672,There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.,No
6673,They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.,No
6674,The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.,Yes
6675,I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.,No
6676,And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.,No
6677,That's what the American worker wants.,No
6678,"And if we do that, we can have an impact.",No
6679,"Plus, we need fiscal discipline.",No
6680,"Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.",No
6683,Let me start with the Pell Grants.,No
6684,In his last litany of misstatements.,No
6685,He said we cut Pell Grants.,No
6686,We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.,Yes
6688,"You know, he talks to the workers.",No
6689,Let me talk to the workers.,No
6690,You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.,Yes
6691,"If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.",Yes
6692,That's money in your pocket.,No
6693,"If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.",Yes
6694,"The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.",No
6695,We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.,Yes
6696,"A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.",Yes
6698,"The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money.",Yes
6699,"""No, we're spending your money.",Yes
6700,"And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.",No
6702,My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.,No
6703,His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.,Yes
6704,He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.,Yes
6706,"Bob, anybody can play with these votes.",No
6708,I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.,Yes
6709,"I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.",Yes
6710,I voted for IRA tax cuts.,Yes
6711,I voted for small-business tax cuts.,Yes
6712,But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?,No
6713,Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.,Yes
6714,"But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.",Yes
6716,We have more people who qualify.,Yes
6717,That's not what we want.,No
6718,"Senator, no one's playing with your votes.",No
6719,You voted to increase taxes 98 times.,Yes
6722,"You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.",No
6723,"As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.",No
6731,I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.,No
6732,It's important that we do that.,No
6733,"And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.",No
6734,And that's to be honored.,No
6735,"But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.",No
6736,I believe in the sanctity of marriage.,No
6737,"I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.",No
6738,I proposed a constitutional amendment.,No
6739,"The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.",No
6740,It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.,No
6741,"After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.",No
6742,I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.,No
6743,"You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.",Yes
6744,My opponent was against it.,No
6745,It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.,No
6746,It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.,No
6747,But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.,No
6748,"And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.",Yes
6750,"We're all God's children, Bob.",No
6751,"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.",No
6752,"I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.",No
6753,"I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.",No
6754,"And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.",No
6755,I think we have to respect that.,No
6756,The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.,No
6758,I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.,No
6760,You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.,No
6761,You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.,No
6762,"You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.",No
6763,"Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.",Yes
6764,"And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.",No
6769,I completely respect their views.,No
6771,And I grew up learning how to respect those views.,No
6772,"But I disagree with them, as do many.",No
6773,I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.,No
6774,What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.,No
6775,I believe that choice is a woman's choice.,No
6777,And that's why I support that.,No
6778,"Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.",No
6779,The president has never said whether or not he would do that.,Yes
6780,But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.,No
6782,I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.,No
6783,"Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.",No
6785,I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.,No
6786,"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president.",Yes
6787,"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """,No
6788,"My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.",No
6789,"There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?",No
6790,"Faith without works is dead. """,No
6791,"And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.",No
6792,That's why I fight against poverty.,No
6793,That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.,No
6794,That's why I fight for equality and justice.,No
6795,All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.,No
6796,"But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.",No
6797,And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.,No
6799,I think it's important to promote a culture of life.,No
6800,I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.,No
6801,I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.,No
6802,"I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.",No
6803,"Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.",No
6805,People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.,Yes
6806,It made a lot of sense.,No
6807,"My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.",No
6808,"What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.",No
6809,"The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.",No
6811,I appreciate that very much.,No
6812,All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.,No
6825,"Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.",No
6826,"There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.",No
6827,Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.,Yes
6828,Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.,Yes
6829,"And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.",Yes
6830,And there's no market forces involved with health care.,Yes
6831,It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.,No
6832,"These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.",No
6833,"Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.",No
6834,But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.,Yes
6835,"Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.",No
6836,That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.,No
6837,"In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent.",Yes
6838,"Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.",Yes
6839,"Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.",Yes
6840,"It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.",No
6841,"And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.",No
6842,We're beginning to do it.,No
6844,"We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.",No
6845,"People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.",No
6846,"And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.",No
6847,"And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.",No
6849,"The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.",No
6850,Let me give you a prime example.,No
6851,In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.,Yes
6852,"But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.",Yes
6853,The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.,Yes
6854,We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.,Yes
6856,The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.,Yes
6857,We could have done that in Medicare.,No
6858,Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.,Yes
6860,"Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.",Yes
6861,"But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.",Yes
6863,That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.,Yes
6864,"When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.",No
6865,"Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.",No
6866,"So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.",Yes
6867,We got to have health care for all Americans.,No
6869,"I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?",No
6870,He has no record on reforming of health care.,Yes
6872,He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.,Yes
6874,I came to Washington to solve problems.,No
6875,I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.,No
6877,"And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.",No
6880,"Once again, the president is misleading America.",No
6891,"Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.",Yes
6893,The other called it untrue.,Yes
6894,"The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.",No
6895,It gives you the choice.,No
6896,I don't force you to do anything.,No
6897,It's not a government plan.,No
6898,The government doesn't require you to do anything.,No
6901,"If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.",No
6902,"You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.",Yes
6904,And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.,No
6905,Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.,No
6906,"And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.",Yes
6908,"I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.",Yes
6909,"We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.",Yes
6911,"I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.",No
6912,"You want to buy into it, you can.",No
6913,We give you broader competition.,No
6915,"In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.",Yes
6916,"And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.",Yes
6919,And I'm going to offer it to America.,No
6921,"In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.",No
6922,"Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.",No
6923,The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.,No
6924,They analyzed the senator's plan.,No
6926,"The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.",Yes
6927,It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.,No
6928,"If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees.",Yes
6929,Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?,No
6930,It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.,Yes
6931,We have a fundamental difference of opinion.,No
6932,"I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.",No
6933,"Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.",No
6934,And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.,No
6935,They have poor-quality health care.,No
6936,"Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.",No
6938,The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality.,Yes
6939,"Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining.",No
6940,Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.,No
6941,He doesn't adequately fund it.,No
6942,But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.,No
6943,That's not what I have.,No
6944,I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.,No
6945,Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.,No
6948,Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president.,Yes
6949,That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.,Yes
6950,"Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.",No
6951,We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country.,Yes
6952,We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.,Yes
6953,"Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.",Yes
6960,"First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.",No
6961,"I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.",No
6962,"Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.",Yes
6964,"And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.",No
6965,And so I think we need to think differently.,No
6966,We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.,No
6967,"But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.",No
6968,"And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue.",Yes
6969,"It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.",No
6970,And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.,No
6971,"I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.",No
6972,And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.,No
6973,I will work with Republicans and Democrats.,No
6974,It'll be a vital issue in my second term.,No
6975,"It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.",No
6976,And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.,No
6977,"But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.",Yes
6979,You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.,Yes
6980,"Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.",No
6981,"The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.",Yes
6982,And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.,Yes
6983,"Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?",Yes
6984,"He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.",Yes
6985,Not one of them are paid for.,Yes
6987,He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.,No
6988,I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.,No
6989,"In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party.",No
6990,We balanced the budget in the '90s.,Yes
6991,We paid down the debt for two years.,Yes
6994,I will not privatize it.,No
6995,I will not cut the benefits.,No
6996,And we're going to be fiscally responsible.,No
6997,And we will take care of Social Security.,No
7005,"This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something.",No
7006,We heard the same thing.,No
7008,"In fact, we put together a $5.6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.",Yes
7009,If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.,Yes
7010,The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.,Yes
7011,"Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.",Yes
7013,"I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.",No
7014,"And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.",Yes
7015,"Now, we can do that.",No
7016,"Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.",No
7017,We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.,No
7018,And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.,No
7019,But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America.,No
7020,"The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.",Yes
7022,"Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.",Yes
7024,"And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.",No
7026,He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time.,Yes
7027,I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.,No
7028,I heard more of the same.,No
7029,He talks about middle-class tax cuts.,No
7030,That's exactly where the tax cuts went.,Yes
7031,Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.,Yes
7032,And now the tax code is more fair.,No
7034,People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.,No
7035,"If you have a child, you got tax relief.",Yes
7036,"If you're married, you got tax relief.",Yes
7037,"If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief.",Yes
7038,All of which was opposed by my opponent.,Yes
7039,And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.,Yes
7040,"People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.",Yes
7041,And it was one of the largest declines in our history.,Yes
7042,"And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.",Yes
7046,And now this economy is growing.,Yes
7047,We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.,Yes
7048,"Sure, there's more work to do.",No
7050,It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.,No
7051,It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.,No
7061,I see it as a serious problem.,No
7062,"I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.",No
7063,We're increasing the border security of the United States.,Yes
7066,We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.,Yes
7067,And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.,No
7068,It's a subject I'm very familiar with.,No
7069,"After all, I was a border governor for a while.",No
7070,Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.,No
7071,They're coming here to work.,No
7072,"If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.",No
7075,That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.,No
7076,"It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.",No
7077,"See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.",No
7078,It also means it takes pressure off the border.,No
7079,"If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.",No
7080,It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.,No
7081,"Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.",No
7083,There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.,No
7084,And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.,No
7085,"If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.",No
7086,And here is where my opponent and I differ.,No
7087,"In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.",Yes
7090,"Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.",No
7091,"The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.",No
7092,"And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.",Yes
7093,"The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929.",Yes
7094,And the take-home pay of the richest .,No
7095,1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.,Yes
7096,"Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.",Yes
7098,"Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform.",Yes
7099,He said he would reform it.,No
7100,Four years later he is now promising another plan.,No
7101,"Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.",Yes
7103,"Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.",No
7104,The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring.,No
7105,"It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.",No
7106,"And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.",No
7107,"We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.",No
7109,"Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.",No
7110,They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.,Yes
7111,We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.,No
7112,"He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.",No
7113,That is an outrageous claim.,No
7114,And we'll continue to protect our borders.,No
7115,We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.,Yes
7117,Four thousand people a day are coming across the border.,Yes
7118,"The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.",No
7119,And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.,No
7121,"We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.",No
7122,"We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.",No
7123,We could speed it up.,No
7125,"The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.",No
7132,It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.,No
7133,"And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.",No
7134,We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.,Yes
7135,But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.,No
7136,We're not allowed to vote on it.,Yes
7137,They don't want to raise the minimum wage.,No
7138,The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.,Yes
7139,"If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.",Yes
7140,"The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.",Yes
7144,Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.,Yes
7146,And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.,Yes
7149,They don't enforce these kinds of things.,No
7150,"Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.",No
7151,"We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.",No
7152,"And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.",No
7153,I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.,No
7154,"Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.",No
7155,But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to.,No
7156,And that's to make sure the education system works.,No
7157,It's to make sure we raise standards.,No
7158,"Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.",No
7159,"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards.",Yes
7161,"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """,No
7163,And we weren't diagnosing problems.,Yes
7164,And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.,No
7165,And guess who would get shuffled through?,No
7166,Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.,No
7167,Many inner-city kids just move through.,Yes
7168,We've stopped that practice now by measuring early.,No
7169,"And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.",No
7170,"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right.",No
7171,"In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.",No
7172,"You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.",No
7176,"What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?",No
7177,"And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.",No
7178,"I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.",No
7187,"Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.",No
7188,I'll answer it straight to America.,No
7189,"I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.",No
7190,And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.,No
7191,So I don't intend to see it undone.,No
7192,"Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.",Yes
7193,But let me go a step further.,No
7194,We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.,No
7195,"I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.",Yes
7196,And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.,Yes
7197,"Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens.",No
7198,The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.,Yes
7199,"He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has.",No
7200,"But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.",No
7203,"One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.",Yes
7204,"And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.",Yes
7206,"But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.",No
7207,He talked about the unemployed.,No
7208,Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.,No
7209,He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?,No
7210,Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.,No
7211,And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.,No
7213,You don't measure it by a percentage increase.,No
7214,"Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.",No
7216,"Now, that's not in my gut.",No
7217,"That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.",No
7218,"$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.",Yes
7229,"Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.",Yes
7231,"Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.",Yes
7232,"One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.",No
7233,"Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.",Yes
7234,"In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.",No
7235,And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.,No
7237,We ought to be doing that.,No
7238,And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.,No
7239,"But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.",No
7240,"I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.",No
7241,He said he would work through a real alliance.,Yes
7242,"He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.",No
7244,And the result is our forces today are overextended.,No
7245,The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.,Yes
7246,"And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.",Yes
7247,And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.,No
7249,"The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.",Yes
7250,"We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.",Yes
7251,"I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.",No
7252,Some of them had been there before.,No
7253,The people I talked to their spirits were high.,No
7254,They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.,No
7255,They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.,No
7256,"My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.",No
7257,In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.,No
7258,"In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval.",No
7259,That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.,No
7262,We'll continue to build strong coalitions.,No
7263,But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.,No
7264,"We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.",No
7266,I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation.,No
7267,"In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.",No
7268,No nation will ever have a veto over us.,No
7270,"That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.",No
7271,But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.,No
7273,"The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.",Yes
7274,Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.,No
7278,"Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.",No
7279,"I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.",Yes
7280,I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.,No
7281,I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.,No
7282,But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.,No
7283,And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.,Yes
7284,And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.,Yes
7285,Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.,No
7286,"To me, that's the best way to secure America.",No
7288,I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.,No
7292,And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.,Yes
7293,But I'll tell you this.,No
7294,I'm also a former law enforcement officer.,No
7295,"I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.",Yes
7296,I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.,No
7297,I've broken up organized crime.,Yes
7298,I know something about prosecuting.,No
7299,And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.,Yes
7300,They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.,No
7301,"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?",No
7302,"We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. """,Yes
7303,"Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.",No
7304,"Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.",Yes
7305,"And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.",Yes
7306,It encouraged them to do it.,No
7307,So I believe America's less safe.,No
7308,"If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, ""Sorry, we don't have the votes,"" I'd have said, ""Then we're going to have a fight. """,No
7309,And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.,Yes
7310,We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.,No
7314,"No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.",No
7315,And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.,No
7316,I'll give you an example.,No
7317,I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.,No
7318,I was chairman of it once.,No
7320,"We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.",No
7321,They don't reach those goals.,No
7322,They don't even fight to reach those goals.,No
7323,They've tried to undo them.,No
7324,"The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.",No
7325,And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.,No
7326,Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.,No
7327,"It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.",No
7328,"I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.",No
7329,"If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.",No
7330,"During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.",No
7331,"And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.",Yes
7332,"So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it.",No
7334,"And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.",No
7335,"As president, I will make certain we travel it.",No
7337,"This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.",Yes
7338,This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.,Yes
7339,This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.,Yes
7341,"I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.",No
7343,"Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.",Yes
7344,I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.,No
7345,"And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas.",No
7347,"But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done.",No
7348,We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.,Yes
7350,"That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.",No
7352,"Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.",Yes
7353,I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.,No
7354,Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.,Yes
7355,"And that's hopeful, and that's positive.",No
7390,I think it's important and I share it.,No
7391,I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.,No
7392,Everything is a gift from the Almighty.,No
7393,"And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.",No
7395,"I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.",No
7397,We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.,Yes
7398,"There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.",No
7399,And we're struggling with that today.,No
7400,And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.,No
7401,I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.,No
7402,I think we've got a lot more work to do.,No
7403,"And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.",No
7410,"Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.",No
7411,"I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.",No
7412,"And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.",No
7413,"And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.",No
7415,That's not where we are today.,No
7416,"I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.",No
7417,I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.,No
7418,I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.,No
7419,We have to change that.,No
7420,"And as president, I am committed to changing that.",No
7421,I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.,No
7422,I think we have to come together and work to change it.,No
7424,"Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues.",No
7425,I've reached across the aisle.,No
7426,"I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.",No
7427,"And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.",No
7428,"And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.",No
7430,My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.,No
7431,"I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing.",Yes
7432,And we made good progress early on.,No
7433,"The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.",No
7434,And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.,Yes
7435,But Washington is a tough town.,No
7436,"And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.",No
7437,"I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.",No
7438,My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time.,No
7439,Pretty divided in the 2000 election.,No
7440,"So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.",Yes
7441,"We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.",No
7442,John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.,No
7443,And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.,No
7452,To stand up straight and not scowl.,No
7456,I am -- you know it's really interesting.,No
7457,"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech.",No
7458,"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal.",No
7459,"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal.",No
7460,And she's out campaigning along with our girls.,No
7461,And she speaks English a lot better than I do.,No
7462,I think people understand what she's saying.,No
7463,"But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush.",No
7464,I can't tell you how lucky I am.,No
7465,"When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.",No
7466,"O'Neill said, ""Come on over.",No
7467,I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.,No
7468,"""So I said all right.",No
7470,There was only four of us there.,No
7473,"Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.",No
7475,And some would say maybe me more so than others.,No
7477,But I can take it.,No
7479,"Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run.",No
7480,"And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing.",No
7481,"And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity.",No
7482,"""Those are the three words that she left me with.",No
7483,"And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.",No
7484,They also kick me around.,No
7486,They don't let me get away with anything.,No
7487,I can sometimes take myself too seriously.,No
7488,They surely don't let me do that.,No

7490,"I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters.",No
7492,And I think we're both very lucky.,No
7495,"My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division.",No

7497,"And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.",No
7498,I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.,No

7519,"In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.",No
7520,"And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.",No
7521,And he said this about it.,No
7522,"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain.",No
7523,"It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side.",No
7526,And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.,No
7527,"We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country.",Yes
7528,"And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing.",Yes
7529,"Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow.",No
7530,"We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close.",No

7536,"And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.",No
7537,"We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world.",No
7538,"My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.",No
7581,"Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.",No
7582,"As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.",No
7584,He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.,No
7585,"I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.",No
7587,Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.,Yes
7588,We think that's pretty good progress.,No
7589,Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.,Yes
7590,"Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.",No
7591,"As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.",No
7592,And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.,Yes
7593,For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.,No
7594,"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.",No
7595,There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.,No
7597,There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.,No
7598,"No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.",No
7601,In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.,No
7602,"Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.",Yes
7603,"Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.",No
7604,"What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.",No
7605,"Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.",Yes
7606,"Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.",No
7607,"I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.",Yes
7612,"Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.",No
7613,In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.,No
7614,"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident.",No
7615,The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.,No
7616,But they were not in accordance with international law.,Yes
7617,"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.",Yes
7618,The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.,Yes
7619,We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.,Yes
7620,The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.,Yes
7621,The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.,Yes
7622,That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.,No
7623,"I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.",No
7626,I believe we should be stronger than we now are.,No
7627,I believe we should have a stronger military force.,No
7628,I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.,No
7629,"But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.",No
7631,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.,No
7632,"First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.",No
7633,He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.,Yes
7634,"Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.",No
7635,The United States is a strong country.,No
7636,"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.",No
7638,"Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.",Yes
7639,This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.,No
7640,We all remember Pearl Harbor.,No
7641,We lost three thousand American lives.,Yes
7642,We cannot afford an intelligence gap.,No
7643,And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.,No
7644,"I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.",No
7645,And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.,No
7649,My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.,No
7651,"And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.",Yes
7652,"Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.",No
7654,That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.,Yes
7655,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.",No
7656,"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.",No
7658,I have talked to Negro mothers.,No
7659,I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.,No
7660,"This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.",No
7661,"So, under the circumstances, what do we do?",No
7662,Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.,Yes
7663,"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?",No
7664,Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.,No
7665,"I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.",No
7666,"I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.",No
7667,"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.",No
7669,"Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?",No
7670,Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.,No
7671,"Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?",No
7672,"He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.",No
7673,"He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.",Yes
7674,"Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.",Yes
7675,These are the great questions: equality of education in school.,No
7676,"About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.",Yes
7677,Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.,Yes
7678,"These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.",No
7679,What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?,No
7680,"Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.",Yes
7681,What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?,No
7682,Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.,No
7683,And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.,No
7687,"From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.",No
7688,"First, as a legislative leader.",No
7689,"And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.",Yes
7690,"Secondly, as an executive leader.",No
7691,There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.,Yes
7692,The right to vote is basic.,No
7693,I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.,Yes
7694,"Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.",No
7695,Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.,No
7696,And that's in all sections of the United States.,No
7697,"And then fourthly, as a moral leader.",No
7698,There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.,No
7699,We are in a very difficult time.,No
7700,We need all the talent we can get.,No
7701,We sit on a conspicuous stage.,No
7703,We have to practice what we preach.,No
7704,We set a very high standard for ourselves.,No
7706,They set a low standard of materialism.,No
7707,"We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.",No
7708,I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.,No
7709,"Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.",No
7710,I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.,No
7711,I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.,No
7712,But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.,No
7713,I would hope an incident like that would not happen.,No
7714,"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.",No
7715,Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.,Yes
7716,"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.""",No
7717,And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.,No
7719,"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.",No
7720,But let's look at the performance.,No
7721,"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.",Yes
7723,I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.,No
7724,Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.,No
7725,And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.,No
7726,"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.",Yes
7727,All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.,No
7728,What we need is action.,No
7729,"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",No
7733,"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.",No
7734,"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",No
7735,"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.",No
7736,"First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.",No
7737,Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.,No
7738,"I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.",No
7739,"Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.",No
7740,"When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.",No
7741,We were on one side; they were on the other side.,No
7744,Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.,No
7745,That's a test of prestige.,No
7746,"Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.",Yes
7748,In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.,No
7749,"It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.",Yes
7751,What tools do we need to fight us?,No
7752,"Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.",No
7753,Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.,Yes
7754,"I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.",Yes
7755,They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.,Yes
7756,They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.,Yes
7757,"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.",No
7758,So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.,No
7759,It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.,No
7760,But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.,No
7762,Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.,Yes
7763,Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.,Yes
7764,I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.,Yes
7765,The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.,Yes
7766,"Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.",No
7767,We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.,No
7768,"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.",Yes
7769,Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.,Yes
7770,We have not maintained our position and our prestige.,No
7771,"A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.",Yes
7772,Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.,No
7773,"The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",Yes
7777,We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.,No
7778,"The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.",Yes
7779,meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.,No
7780,"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.",Yes
7781,"Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.",Yes
7782,"We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.",Yes
7783,"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.",No
7784,This permits them to maintain their self-respect.,No
7785,It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.,No
7786,And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.,No
7787,I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.,No
7788,"And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.",No
7790,"And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.",No
7791,"And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.",Yes
7792,I think the United States can afford to do these things.,No
7793,I think that we could not afford not to do these things.,No
7794,This goes to our survival.,No
7795,"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.",No
7796,"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",No
7797,I believe we can do it.,No
7798,"If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.",No
7800,Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.,No
7802,"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.",No
7803,We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.,No
7804,"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.",No
7805,We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.,No
7806,"We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.",No
7807,This we must get across to the world.,No
7808,"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.",No
7809,The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.,No
7810,This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.,No
7811,We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.,No
7812,We must stand for our ideals.,No
7817,To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.,No
7818,"Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.",Yes
7819,Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.,Yes
7820,On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.,Yes
7821,"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.",No
7822,I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.,Yes
7823,"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.",No
7824,"In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.",Yes
7825,It also exists among minority groups.,Yes
7826,"If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.",No
7827,"That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.",No
7828,"Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.",No
7829,I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.,No
7830,"But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.",No
7831,This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.,No
7832,I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.,No
7833,So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.,No
7834,But I do not expect it to come.,No
7837,I'm very familiar with it.,No
7838,It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.,Yes
7840,"We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.",Yes
7841,We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.,Yes
7842,Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.,Yes
7843,Our bill was far more effective.,No
7844,The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.,Yes
7845,"Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.",No
7846,I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.,Yes
7848,Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.,Yes
7849,"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.",No
7850,"If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.",No
7851,One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.,No
7852,The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.,No
7857,Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.,Yes
7858,The question is what we're going to do in the future.,No
7859,I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.,No
7860,In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.,No
7861,I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.,No
7862,Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.,No
7863,Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.,No
7864,"He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.",No
7866,"And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.",No
7868,President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.,No
7870,That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.,No
7872,"Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.",No
7873,"If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.",Yes
7874,"In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.",No
7875,We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.,Yes
7876,Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.,Yes
7877,We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.,No
7878,Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.,Yes
7879,He's had experience in it.,No
7880,"And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.",No
7881,I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.,No
7883,"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.",No
7884,In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.,No
7885,I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.,No
7886,Let me make my position cl ear.,No
7887,I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.,No
7888,I'm proud of the record of this Administration.,No
7889,I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.,No
7890,Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.,No
7891,But what does he offer?,No
7892,He offers retreads of programs that failed.,Yes
7893,"I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.",Yes
7894,"And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.",Yes
7895,I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.,No
7896,I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.,No
7897,"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.",No
7901,"No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.",Yes
7902,It would not be appropriate for me to do so.,No
7903,"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",No
7904,"As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.",No
7905,I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.,No
7906,"I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.",No
7907,We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.,No
7908,"There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.",Yes
7909,He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.,No
7910,"Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.",No
7911,"Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.",No
7912,"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",No
7914,I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.,No
7915,It - my view is the same as his.,No
7916,Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.,No
7917,"That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.",No
7918,"If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.",No
7919,"Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.",No
7920,It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.,No
7921,It's going to be a test of our strength.,No
7922,"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.",No
7924,"I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.",No
7931,"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.",No
7932,"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.",No
7933,"If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.",No
7934,I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.,No
7935,I'm talking about a national mood.,No
7936,I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.,No
7937,We don't know what the future's going to bring.,No
7938,But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.,No
7940,That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.,No
7941,"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.",No
7942,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",No
7943,So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.,No
7945,We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.,Yes
7946,"And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.",No
7947,"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.",No
7948,I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.,No
7950,Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.,No
7951,"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.",No
7952,In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.,No
7953,I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.,No
7955,I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.,No
7956,But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.,No
7957,"Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.",No
7958,"I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.",No
7959,"The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.",Yes
7960,But it isn't going to be working that way.,No
7961,You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.,No
7962,"After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.",Yes
7967,"And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.",Yes
7968,What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.,Yes
7969,"Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.",No
7970,He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.,Yes
7971,And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?,No
7972,"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.",Yes
7973,In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.,Yes
7974,"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.",No
7975,"But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.",No
7976,I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.,No
7977,I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.,No
7978,I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.,No
7979,Now this just wasn't true.,Yes
7980,"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.",No
7982,"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.",No
7983,"Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.",No
7984,It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.,No
7985,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.,No
7986,"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.",No
7987,"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.",No
7988,And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.,No
7990,"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.",Yes
7991,"Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.",Yes
7992,And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.,No
7993,Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.,No
7995,You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.,Yes
7996,I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.,Yes
7997,And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.,No
7998,And we ought to try to meet the problem.,No
7999,"Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.",No
8001,I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.,Yes
8002,"Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.",Yes
8003,So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.,No
8007,"Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.",Yes
8008,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.,No
8009,"These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.",No
8011,We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.,No
8012,But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.,No
8013,"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.",Yes
8014,"Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.",Yes
8015,General Ridgway has said the same thing.,Yes
8017,"One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.",No
8018,I believe that we should defend Formosa.,No
8019,We should come to its defense.,No
8020,"To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.",No
8021,"Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.",No
8022,It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.,No
8023,It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.,No
8024,"But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.",No
8025,I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.,No
8026,I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.,No
8027,I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.,No
8028,But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.,No
8029,"And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.",No
8031,I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.,No
8032,"I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.",No
8034,"And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.",Yes
8035,I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.,No
8036,But it didn't mean that.,No
8037,We had to go in when they came in.,No
8038,"Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.",No
8039,It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.,No
8041,These two islands are in the area of freedom.,No
8042,The Nationalists have these two islands.,Yes
8043,We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.,No
8044,"If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.",Yes
8045,In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.,No
8047,"I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.",No
8054,"Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.",No
8055,"I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.",No
8056,Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.,No
8057,"The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.",No
8058,"Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.",No
8061,It's what we stand for.,No
8063,"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican.""",No
8064,"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.""",No
8066,What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.,No
8067,Now that means the best leadership.,No
8068,"It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.",No
8069,But the people are the ones that determine it.,No
8070,The people have to make up their minds.,No
8071,"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did.""",No
8072,"I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.",No
8073,"Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.",Yes
8074,"All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.",No
8075,"They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.",No
8076,This is what I deeply believe.,No
8077,I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.,No
8078,"I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.",No
8080,"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.",No
8081,Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.,No
8082,The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.,No
8083,It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.,No
8084,"It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.",No
8085,"The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.",No
8086,They do stand for something.,No
8087,They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.,No
8088,That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.,No
8089,"And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.",Yes
8109,"In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.",No
8110,"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.",No
8111,"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.",No
8112,"We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.",No
8113,"Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.",No
8114,The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.,No
8115,But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.,No
8116,"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.",No
8117,"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",No
8118,"If we fail, then freedom fails.",No
8119,"Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?",No
8120,Are we as strong as we should be?,No
8121,"Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?",No
8122,"I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.",No
8125,I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.,Yes
8126,Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.,No
8127,"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.",Yes
8128,"I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.",No
8129,I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.,Yes
8130,"I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.",No
8131,I think we should have an educational system second to none.,No
8132,I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.,No
8133,I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.,No
8134,"Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.",No
8135,"These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.",No
8137,If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.,Yes
8138,He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.,Yes
8139,"He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.",Yes
8140,He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.,Yes
8141,I think we can do better.,No
8142,I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.,No
8143,I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.,No
8145,I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.,No
8146,And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.,No
8147,But I think there is also a national responsibility.,No
8148,The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.,No
8149,The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.,No
8150,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",No
8151,"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.",Yes
8152,"I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.",No
8153,And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.,No
8154,It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.,No
8155,I think we can do a better job.,No
8156,I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.,No
8157,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.,No
8158,"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.",No
8159,And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.,No
8160,The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.,No
8161,Because they felt that the American society was moving again.,No
8162,I want us to recapture that image.,No
8163,"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.",No
8165,"In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.",Yes
8166,I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.,No
8167,The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?,No
8168,I think it can be.,No
8169,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.,No
8170,I think it's time America started moving again.,No
8173,The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.,No
8174,There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.,No
8175,"There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.",No
8176,"We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.",No
8177,"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.",No
8178,"And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.",No
8179,"Where, then, do we disagree?",No
8180,I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.,No
8181,"We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.",Yes
8182,"Now last year, of course, was 1958.",No
8183,That happened to be a recession year.,No
8184,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.,No
8185,"this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.",Yes
8187,"Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.",No
8189,"Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?",No
8190,"Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",No
8191,"Well, we have a comparison that we can make.",No
8192,We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.,No
8193,"When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.",No
8195,"We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.",Yes
8197,We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.,Yes
8199,We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.,Yes
8200,The same is true of highways.,Yes
8201,Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.,No
8202,We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.,Yes
8203,That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.,Yes
8204,But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.,No
8205,What has happened to you?,No
8206,We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.,Yes
8207,What about the prices you pay?,No
8208,We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.,Yes
8209,What's the net result of this?,No
8210,This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years.,Yes
8211,"Now, this is not standing still.",No
8212,"But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.",No
8213,A record is never something to stand on.,No
8214,It's something to build on.,No
8215,"And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.",No
8216,"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.",No
8217,Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.,No
8218,I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.,No
8219,"But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.",No
8220,They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.,No
8221,"And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.",No
8223,"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.",No
8224,"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.",No
8225,"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.",No
8226,We both want to help the old people.,No
8227,We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.,No
8228,The question is the means.,No
8230,"I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.",No
8231,"Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.",No
8232,I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.,No
8233,I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.,No
8234,It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.,Yes
8235,Now the Republican platform will cost more too.,No
8236,"It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.",Yes
8237,"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",No
8240,It is a question of which administration does the right thing.,No
8241,"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",No
8242,"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",No
8243,"The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.",Yes
8244,Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.,No
8245,I know what it means to be poor.,No
8246,I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.,No
8247,"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",No
8256,"I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.",No
8257,"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?",No
8258,"I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.",No
8259,Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.,No
8260,He was nominated by it.,No
8261,"And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.",Yes
8262,I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.,No
8263,I hope he would grant me the same.,No
8264,The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?,No
8270,It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.,No
8271,I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.,No
8272,"First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.",Yes
8273,"For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.",No
8274,"After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.",Yes
8275,"Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.",Yes
8276,"Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.",No
8277,I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.,Yes
8278,I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.,Yes
8279,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",No
8280,"You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.",No
8281,I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.,No
8282,In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.,Yes
8283,"In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.",Yes
8284,I think it's true of Latin America also.,Yes
8285,"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",Yes
8294,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",No
8295,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,No
8296,There are hundreds of thousands of them.,No
8297,They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.,No
8298,"They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.",No
8299,They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.,No
8300,I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.,Yes
8301,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",No
8302,The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.,Yes
8303,The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.,Yes
8304,"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",No
8305,So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.,No
8306,"Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",No
8307,"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.",Yes
8308,We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.,Yes
8309,I think that this farm policy has failed.,No
8311,And that can only be done through governmental action.,No
8312,"I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.",Yes
8313,I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.,No
8314,"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.",No
8315,I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.,No
8316,"I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.",Yes
8317,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,No
8320,"He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.",No
8321,I think this is the wrong direction.,No
8322,I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.,No
8323,The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.,Yes
8324,It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.,No
8325,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,No
8326,The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.,Yes
8327,"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",No
8328,"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",No
8329,"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",No
8337,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.",No
8338,"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",No
8339,The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.,Yes
8340,"Now, I can only say this.",No
8341,Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.,No
8342,I have been in the cabinet.,No
8343,I have met with the legislative leaders.,No
8344,"I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.",No
8345,The President has asked for my advice.,No
8347,Sometimes my advice has been taken.,No
8349,I do not say that I have made the decisions.,No
8350,"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.",No
8351,All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.,No
8352,"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.",No
8354,"As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.",No
8355,His experience has been different from mine.,No
8356,Mine has been in the executive branch.,No
8357,His has been in the legislative branch.,No
8358,I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.,No
8360,"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",No
8361,Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.,Yes
8362,There's no certain road to the presidency.,No
8363,There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.,No
8364,I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.,No
8365,I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.,No
8366,"I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",No
8367,The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,No
8373,"I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.",Yes
8374,"I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.",No
8375,"And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",Yes
8381,Not reducing the interest -,No
8383,#NAME?,No
8384,"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.",No
8385,"What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.",No
8386,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.",No
8387,The Vice President and I disagree on this.,Yes
8388,"The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.",Yes
8389,"The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.",Yes
8390,"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.",No
8391,I think that's a good investment.,No
8392,I think we're going to have to do it.,No
8393,"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.",No
8394,There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.,No
8395,"On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.",No
8396,I believe in the balanced budget.,No
8397,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.,No
8398,"Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.",Yes
8399,"Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",No
8402,"I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.",No
8403,"I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.",No
8404,As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.,No
8405,As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.,Yes
8406,"That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.",No
8407,He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.,No
8408,"Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.",No
8409,"And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.",No
8410,"If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.",No
8412,I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.,No
8419,I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.,No
8420,"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",Yes
8421,"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",No
8423,Why do I take it now?,No
8424,"We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.",No
8425,We need higher teachers' salaries.,No
8426,But we also want our education to be free of federal control.,No
8427,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.",No
8428,I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.,No
8429,There is another point that should be made.,No
8430,I favor higher salaries for teachers.,No
8431,"But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.",Yes
8432,"I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.",No
8433,"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.",No
8434,Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.,Yes
8435,This is not enough; it should be more.,No
8436,But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.,No
8438,"My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",No
8440,"When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",Yes
8441,The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.,No
8442,The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.,No
8443,On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.,Yes
8444,"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.",Yes
8445,I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.,No
8446,"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",No
8447,And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.,Yes
8448,"Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.",No
8449,"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.",Yes
8450,That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.,No
8451,My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.,No
8456,Well as you take the bills -,No
8458,"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.",Yes
8459,It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.,Yes
8461,We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.,Yes
8462,All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.,Yes
8463,"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",Yes
8464,It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.,Yes
8465,It was killed in the Rules Committee.,Yes
8466,And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.,Yes
8467,Four Democrats voted for it.,Yes
8469,"Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.",Yes
8470,We wanted to tie it to Social Security.,Yes
8471,We offered an amendment to do so.,Yes
8472,"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.",Yes
8473,And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.,Yes
8474,"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.",No
8475,"But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",No
8477,Well obviously my views are a little different.,No
8478,"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.",No
8479,"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",Yes
8480,It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.,No
8481,I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.,No
8482,"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.",No
8484,If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,No
8485,The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.,No
8486,It was because they were too extreme.,No
8487,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",No
8490,"I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.",No
8491,"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.",No
8492,"We cannot, of course, control the Senate.",No
8493,"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",No
8494,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,No
8496,"Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.",Yes
8497,"And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.",No
8498,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",No
8499,You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.,No
8500,"And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",No
8502,"Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.",No
8503,One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.,Yes
8504,I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.,Yes
8505,Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.,No
8506,"It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.",No
8507,"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.",Yes
8508,"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",Yes
8509,I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.,No
8510,But I do say a majority are.,Yes
8511,And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.,Yes
8512,"The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.",No
8513,It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.,Yes
8514,"The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.",Yes
8515,So these are three programs which are quite moderate.,No
8516,I think it shows the difference between the two parties.,No
8517,One party is ready to move in these programs.,No
8518,The other party gives them lip service.,No
8522,"Well, I think they're serious.",No
8523,I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.,No
8524,We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.,No
8525,"We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.",No
8526,"I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.",No
8527,The major threat is external and will continue.,No
8529,I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.,No
8530,The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.,No
8531,It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.,No
8532,"We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.",No
8534,It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.,No
8535,We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.,No
8536,"And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.",No
8537,"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.",No
8538,The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.,No
8544,As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.,No
8545,Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.,No
8547,"The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.",No
8548,We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.,Yes
8549,Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.,Yes
8550,"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.",Yes
8553,That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.,No
8555,"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.",Yes
8556,"Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.",No
8557,And I think we have a powerful country.,No
8558,"I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.",No
8559,The Soviet Union is making great gains.,No
8560,"It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.",No
8561,"I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.",No
8570,"First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.",No
8571,The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.,Yes
8572,But the reason for that is obvious.,No
8573,They start from a much lower base.,No
8574,"Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.",Yes
8575,That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.,Yes
8576,"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.",Yes
8577,Is this any reason for complacency?,No
8578,Not at all Because these are determined men.,No
8580,And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.,No
8581,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.,No
8582,Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.,No
8583,"I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.",No
8584,"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.",No
8585,There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.,No
8586,The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.,No
8587,"Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.",Yes
8588,It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.,Yes
8589,But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.,No
8590,"His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.",Yes
8591,And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.,Yes
8592,Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.,No
8593,The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.,Yes
8594,We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.,Yes
8595,It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.,No
8599,The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.,Yes
8600,I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.,No
8601,I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.,No
8602,"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.",No
8603,"Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.",No
8604,Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.,No
8606,I think it's a very clear contrast.,No
8607,"In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.",Yes
8608,Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.,Yes
8609,"In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.",Yes
8610,"Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.",No
8611,The means are at question.,No
8613,"If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.",No
8614,I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.,No
8615,"But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.",No
8616,"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?",No
8618,And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.,No
8619,"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.",No
8620,"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.",No
8621,I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.,No
8622,"That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.",No
8623,I think we're ready to move.,No
8624,"And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.",No
8660,"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.",No
8661,"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.",No
8662,The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.,No
8663,But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.,No
8664,"Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.",Yes
8665,"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.",Yes
8666,"That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.",No
8667,"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.",Yes
8669,I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.,No
8670,"And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.",Yes
8671,"That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.",Yes
8674,"fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.",No
8679,"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.",No
8680,"perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.",No
8681,"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",No
8682,"And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.",No
8683,"And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.",No
8684,You are robbing the American people of their savings.,No
8685,"And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.",No
8686,"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.",No
8687,"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.",No
8688,"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.",Yes
8689,"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.",No
8690,"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",Yes
8692,...and $500 billion over the next five.,Yes
8694,"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.",Yes
8695,"I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.",No
8696,those imports have been reduced.,Yes
8697,"And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.",Yes
8698,"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",Yes
8699,Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.,No
8700,"put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.",No
8701,"Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.",No
8702,their Social Security tax payments by 50%.,Yes
8703,"That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",No
8705,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.",No
8706,"It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.",Yes
8707,"And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.",No
8709,Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?,No
8711,"And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.",No
8712,"or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.",No
8713,"Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",Yes
8719,"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.",No
8720,"But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.",No
8721,"To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.",No
8722,"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.",Yes
8723,But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.,No
8724,"And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.",No
8725,"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.",Yes
8726,"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.",Yes
8727,"I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.",No
8728,"We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.",No
8729,"the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.",No
8730,All of these things can be done.,No
8731,When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.,Yes
8732,have leased only 2% of the possible.,Yes
8733,"possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.",Yes
8734,"That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.",No
8738,"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.",No
8739,"all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.",No
8740,"I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.",No
8741,"and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.",Yes
8742,"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.",No
8743,"But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.",No
8744,We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.,No
8745,"We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.",No
8746,"We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.",No
8747,"I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.",Yes
8748,"Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.",No
8749,"According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.",Yes
8750,"So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",No
8752,"Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.",No
8753,I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.,No
8754,"But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.",No
8755,"That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.",Yes
8756,"As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.",No
8757,"Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.",Yes
8758,And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.,Yes
8759,"So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.",No
8760,"But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.",Yes
8762,"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.",No
8763,"And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.",No
8764,"Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.",Yes
8765,"The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.",Yes
8766,And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.,No
8767,"It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.",Yes
8768,"I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.",No
8777,"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.",No
8779,"And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.",Yes
8780,"Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.",Yes
8782,public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.,Yes
8783,"I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.",Yes
8784,"But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.",Yes
8785,"And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.",Yes
8786,"And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.",No
8787,And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.,No
8788,"So, yes, I told the American Legion National!",No
8789,"Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.",Yes
8791,"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",No
8795,"Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.",No
8796,"I. too, believe in the voluntary military.",No
8797,"As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.",Yes
8798,"I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.",No
8799,Recognize that we have a voluntary military.,No
8800,"We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.",No
8801,"And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.",No
8802,As an aid to enlistment.,No
8803,"we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.",Yes
8804,"Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.",Yes
8805,"In 1977, we took that away from the military.",Yes
8806,That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.,Yes
8807,"So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.",No
8808,"Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.",No
8809,"We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.",No
8810,"Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.",No
8811,"The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.",No
8813,I saw a high school that is military.,No
8817,I'll catch up with it later.,No
8821,"I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.",No
8823,"or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.",Yes
8825,"But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.",Yes
8826,I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.,Yes
8827,"The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.",Yes
8828,I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.,No
8830,"Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.",No
8831,But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.,No
8832,He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.,No
8833,"And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.",No
8834,"We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.",No
8836,"And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.",Yes
8843,I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.,No
8844,I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.,No
8845,The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!,No
8846,me that the Federal grants that come with.,No
8847,"for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.",No
8848,"If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.",No
8849,"What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?",No
8850,Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.,Yes
8851,I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.,No
8852,"But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?",No
8853,New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.,Yes
8854,"But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.",Yes
8855,Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?,No
8856,"But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.",No
8857,"I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.",No
8858,"The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.",Yes
8859,And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?,No
8860,Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.,No
8861,The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.,No
8862,We could have an urban homestead act.,No
8863,"We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.",Yes
8864,"What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.",No
8865,"All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .",No
8869,"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.",Yes
8870,"It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.",Yes
8871,"Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.",Yes
8872,"I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.",Yes
8873,"We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.",No
8874,"I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.",Yes
8875,"And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.",No
8877,"It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.",No
8878,"That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.",No
8879,"In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.",No
8883,John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.,No
8884,It will come from the pockets of the people.,No
8885,It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.,No
8887,"if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.",No
8888,"Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.",No
8889,But the Federal Government doesn't make money.,Yes
8890,It just takes - from the people.,No
8891,"And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.",No
8892,"Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.",Yes
8893,"I stood there, and I met the people.",No
8894,And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.,No
8895,"And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.",No
8896,"But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.",No
8898,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?",No
8899,It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.,Yes
8900,"We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.",Yes
8902,It's because they have lost their industry.,No
8903,And why have they lost their industry?,No
8904,"It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.",No
8905,"I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.",No
8912,"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.",No
8913,"When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.",No
8914,"Well, we've seen what has happened.",No
8915,We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.,Yes
8916,"Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.",Yes
8917,"And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.",Yes
8919,I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.,No
8920,"His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.",Yes
8921,"He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics.""",No
8922,I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.,No
8923,"I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.",No
8924,"But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.",Yes
8926,"And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.",Yes
8927,"So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.",No
8929,"I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.",No
8930,"But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",No
8934,"Miss Quinn, I don't have to.",No
8936,"We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.",No
8937,"And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.",Yes
8938,"And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.",No
8939,how well it could be done.,No
8940,"Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.",No
8941,"And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.",Yes
8942,"Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.",No
8943,Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.,No
8944,But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.,Yes
8945,Government always needs the money it gets.,No
8946,"And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.",Yes
8947,"Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.",Yes
8948,And that state we controlled spending.,Yes
8949,We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.,Yes
8950,"But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.",Yes
8951,I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.,Yes
8952,"And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.",Yes
8953,"And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.",Yes
8954,We have considered inflation in our figures.,No
8955,"We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.",No
8956,"I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.",No
8957,"But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.",No
8958,We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.,No
8960,"Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.",No
8962,"But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.",Yes
8964,"more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.",Yes
8965,"But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.",Yes
8966,"It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.",Yes
8967,"In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.",Yes
8968,And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.,No
8970,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.",No
8971,And John has just made up some very interesting figures.,No
8972,"We took the Senate report, of course.",No
8973,"But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.",No
8975,"The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.",Yes
8976,It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.,Yes
8977,"And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.",No
8978,"And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.",Yes
8979,"And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.",Yes
8991,"Oh, I'm it's my question.",No
8992,"But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.",No
8993,"Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.",No
8994,For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.,No
8995,For a return to traditions and values that we once had.,No
8996,"Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.",No
8997,That we're a nation under God.,No
8998,"Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.",No
8999,"I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.",Yes
9001,"But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.",No
9002,That's what elections are all about.,No
9007,"Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.",No
9008,"But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.",No
9010,I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.,No
9011,"And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.",No
9012,"And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government.",No
9014,I believe in freedom of choice.,No
9015,I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.,No
9016,I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.,No
9018,"And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.",Yes
9019,"But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.",No
9020,"And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.",Yes
9021,"I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, ""Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work.""",No
9022,"But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.",No
9024,"The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.",No
9025,"Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.",No
9026,I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.,No
9028,That's the one who is being aborted.,No
9029,And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.,No
9030,"I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?",No
9031,I happen to believe it is.,No
9033,I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.,No
9034,"And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.",No
9035,"And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.",No
9037,"Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.",No
9038,And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.,No
9039,But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.,Yes
9040,And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.,No
9041,"Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.",No
9042,"That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.",No
9043,We came from 100 different corners of the earth.,No
9044,We spoke a multitude of tongues.,No
9045,"We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.",No
9046,"If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.",No
9047,"And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.",No
9048,"Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.",No
9050,we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.,No
9051,"And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.",No
9052,That the best is over.,No
9053,That we must cut back.,No
9054,That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.,No
9055,"That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.",No
9056,"Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.",No
9057,We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.,No
9058,But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.,No
9059,"The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.",No
9060,"For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.",No
9062,I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.,No
9064,"We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.",No
9065,I think we ought to get at it.,No
9067,"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.",No
9068,I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft.,Yes
9069,"We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.",No
9070,"I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me.",No
9071,I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.,No
9072,I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.,No
9073,"If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?",No
9074,Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?,Yes
9075,Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?,No
9076,Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?,Yes
9077,I don't think you do think that.,No
9078,"And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.",No
9079,"You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.",No
9080,"It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.",No
9081,We've got to stop drifting.,No
9082,What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.,No
9084,"And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.",No
9085,"If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.",No
9086,"The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?",No
9087,"The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.",Yes
9088,"Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.",No
9126,"I appreciate your -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time.",No
9127,Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.,No
9129,Your question -- your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.,No
9131,I can't find a job.,No
9132,I've got three part- time jobs.,No
9133,They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.,No
9134,"I can't begin to pay back my student loans.""",No
9135,So what we have to do is two things.,No
9137,"And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.",No
9138,"When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.",No
9139,"If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution.",Yes
9140,I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.,No
9141,"We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.",No
9142,But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.,No
9143,"And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.",No
9144,I want you to be able to get a job.,No
9146,"With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.",Yes
9147,"And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.",No
9148,And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.,No
9149,So more debt and less jobs.,No
9151,I know what it takes to create good jobs again.,No
9152,I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.,No
9153,"And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.",No
9154,It's not going to be like the last four years.,No
9155,"The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce.",Yes
9156,"I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?",No
9159,"When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.",No
9160,I'm going to make sure you get a job.,No
9165,And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.,Yes
9166,"Not just to you, but to the entire nation.",No
9167,"Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.",No
9168,"But not just jobs, good paying jobs.",No
9169,Ones that can support a family.,No
9171,And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.,No
9172,"Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.",No
9173,Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.,No
9174,I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.,No
9175,"I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.",No
9176,It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.,Yes
9177,"Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.",No
9178,"And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.",Yes
9179,"Number three, we've got to control our own energy.",No
9180,"Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.",No
9181,"That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.",No
9182,"We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.",No
9183,Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.,No
9184,"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.",No
9185,"We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.",No
9191,"And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.",No
9192,The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.,Yes
9193,We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.,Yes
9194,"If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.",Yes
9195,"But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.",Yes
9196,We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.,No
9197,That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.,Yes
9198,It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.,No
9199,It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.,No
9200,"And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.",Yes
9202,My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.,Yes
9203,"And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.",No
9204,"Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.",Yes
9205,You took General Motors bankrupt.,Yes
9207,"So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.",No
9208,"And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.",No
9209,That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.,Yes
9212,"Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.",No
9213,He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.,No
9214,And we would have lost a million jobs.,Yes
9215,"And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.",No
9216,But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.,No
9217,And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?,No
9218,Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.,No
9219,He has a one-point plan.,No
9220,And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.,No
9221,"That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.",No
9222,You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.,Yes
9223,You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.,Yes
9224,"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.",No
9225,That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.,Yes
9226,That's what's been squeezing middle class families.,Yes
9227,And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.,No
9228,The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.,No
9231,That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...,No
9235,"... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.",No
9241,The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.,No
9242,So here's what I've done since I've been president.,No
9245,We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.,Yes
9246,But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.,No
9248,That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.,Yes
9249,"That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.",Yes
9250,That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.,Yes
9251,And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.,Yes
9252,"Now, I want to build on that.",No
9253,"And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.",No
9254,We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.,Yes
9256,And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.,No
9257,"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.",No
9258,"Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.",Yes
9259,"So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.",No
9260,"And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.",No
9261,"Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.",Yes
9262,And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.,No
9263,I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.,No
9264,That's going to help Jeremy get a job.,No
9265,It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.,No
9267,"Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.",No
9268,"And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.",Yes
9269,"As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.",Yes
9271,"Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.",Yes
9273,Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.,Yes
9274,What was his participation there?,No
9275,"The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.",No
9276,And what was the cost?,No
9277,20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.,Yes
9278,"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.",No
9279,"I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.",No
9280,"But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.",No
9281,"This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.",No
9282,Talk to the people that are working in those industries.,No
9284,"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job.""",No
9285,"The head of the EPA said, ""You can't build a coal plant.",No
9286,"You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations.""",No
9287,"When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.",Yes
9288,That's not the right course for America.,No
9289,"Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.",No
9290,"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.",No
9291,"Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.",Yes
9293,"I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.",No
9295,How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?,No
9297,"This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.",No
9301,"Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.",Yes
9302,And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.,No
9303,We've opened up public lands.,Yes
9304,We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.,Yes
9305,And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.,No
9306,We're encouraging it and working with the industry.,No
9307,"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down.",No
9308,And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.,No
9309,So what I've tried to do is be consistent.,No
9310,"With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.",Yes
9311,"Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.",Yes
9312,And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.,Yes
9313,"Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.",Yes
9315,"That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.",Yes
9316,"That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.",No
9317,But that's not what you've done in the last four years.,No
9319,"In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.",Yes
9321,So how much did you cut (inaudible)?,No
9323,"How much did you cut them by, then?",No
9324,"Governor, we have actually produced more oil --",Yes
9326,How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?,No
9327,"Governor Romney, here's what we did.",No
9328,There were a whole bunch of oil companies.,No
9330,"No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?",No
9331,You want me to answer a question --,No
9337,You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.,Yes
9338,"So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.",No
9340,"So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.",No
9342,And so what we did was take away those leases.,No
9343,And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.,Yes
9344,And production on private -- on government land --,No
9354,"Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.",Yes
9356,"I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.",Yes
9357,The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.,No
9358,I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.,No
9359,You'll get your chance in a moment.,No
9362,And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --,No
9368,"I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.",No
9369,"And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.",No
9370,"If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.",Yes
9372,"When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.",Yes
9373,"Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.",Yes
9374,The price of electricity is up.,Yes
9375,"If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.",Yes
9376,"I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.",No
9377,"And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.",No
9378,Those things will get us the energy we need.,No
9381,"Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.",No
9382,"He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.",Yes
9384,"Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.",Yes
9385,"So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.",No
9386,"What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.",No
9387,"And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.",Yes
9388,"So, I'm all for pipelines.",No
9389,I'm all for oil production.,No
9390,What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.,No
9391,"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says ""these are imaginary jobs.""",No
9392,"When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.",Yes
9393,I'd get rid of it.,No
9394,That's not an energy strategy for the future.,No
9398,He gets the first --,No
9402,He actually got the first question.,No
9403,So I get the last question -- last answer --,No
9411,"Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.",No
9414,I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.,No
9415,I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.,No
9416,I'm going to make sure --,No
9418,-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.,No
9419,We'll bring back manufacturing to America.,No
9420,"We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.",No
9421,It's critical to our future.,No
9422,"Candy, it's not going to --",No
9437,"And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.",No
9438,And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.,Yes
9439,"You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.",Yes
9440,"Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.",Yes
9443,The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.,No
9444,So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.,No
9445,That's part -- that's part one.,No
9447,"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.",No
9448,The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.,Yes
9449,So that'll stay the same.,No
9450,Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.,Yes
9451,"And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.",No
9452,"Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.",No
9453,"But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.",Yes
9454,No tax on your savings.,No
9455,That makes life a lot easier.,No
9456,"If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.",Yes
9458,"Because under the last four years, they've been buried.",No
9459,And I want to help people in the middle-class.,No
9460,"And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.",No
9462,"The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.",No
9463,Not just at the high end.,No
9465,I will not let that happen.,No
9466,"I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.",Yes
9467,And what's that going to do?,No
9468,"It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.",No
9470,My philosophy on taxes has been simple.,No
9471,"And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.",No
9472,Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.,No
9473,"Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.",No
9474,So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.,No
9476,"I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.",No
9477,And we've cut them 18 times.,Yes
9478,"And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.",No
9479,"But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.",No
9480,"So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.",Yes
9481,"And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.",Yes
9482,I'm ready to sign that bill right now.,No
9483,The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.,Yes
9484,"But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.",No
9485,We created 23 million new jobs.,Yes
9486,That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.,Yes
9488,"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.",No
9489,"He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?",No
9490,"And he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair.""",No
9491,"Not only that, he said, ""I think that's what grows the economy.""",Yes
9492,"Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.",No
9493,I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.,No
9497,So we just have a different theory.,No
9498,"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.",No
9499,And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.,No
9502,You heard what I said about my tax plan.,No
9504,I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.,No
9505,I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.,No
9506,"And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?",No
9507,"Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.",Yes
9508,"And for me, this is about jobs.",No
9509,I want to get America's economy going again.,No
9510,Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.,Yes
9511,"So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.",Yes
9512,"For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.",No
9513,We can do better than this.,No
9514,"We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.",Yes
9515,There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.,Yes
9517,We can get this economy going again.,No
9518,My five-point plan does it.,No
9519,Energy independence for North America in five years.,No
9520,"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",No
9521,Cracking down on China when they cheat.,No
9522,Getting us to a balanced budget.,No
9523,Fixing our training programs for our workers.,No
9524,"And finally, championing small business.",No
9525,I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.,No
9526,I know how to make that happen.,No
9527,I spent my life in the private sector.,No
9528,I know why jobs come and why they go.,No
9529,And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.,No
9534,"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.",Yes
9536,Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.,Yes
9538,He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.,Yes
9539,That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.,Yes
9540,"Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.",No
9541,"But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?",No
9543,The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.,Yes
9544,"He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.",Yes
9545,We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.,No
9546,"Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.",No
9547,"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.",No
9548,"And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.",Yes
9549,"Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.",No
9550,You're going to be paying for it.,No
9551,"You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.",No
9552,"Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.",No
9559,Well of course they add up.,No
9560,"I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.",No
9561,I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.,No
9562,"I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.",Yes
9563,"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?",Yes
9564,That's math that doesn't add up.,No
9565,We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.,No
9566,"And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.",Yes
9568,"We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.",Yes
9569,"If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.",Yes
9570,This puts us on a road to Greece.,No
9571,I know what it takes to balance budgets.,No
9572,I've done it my entire life.,No
9573,"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut.""",No
9575,Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.,No
9583,"And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...",No
9589,"And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.",No
9593,And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.,No
9594,"My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.",No
9595,"She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.",No
9596,"And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.",No
9597,She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.,No
9599,That's not what you did in that generation.,No
9600,And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.,No
9601,"And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.",No
9603,"And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.",No
9604,"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.",No
9605,It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.,No
9606,"Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.",Yes
9607,"Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.",No
9608,"We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.",Yes
9609,"We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.",Yes
9610,Let's give the money directly to students.,No
9611,"And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.",Yes
9612,"But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.",No
9613,That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.,No
9614,I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.,No
9617,"And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.",No
9618,"And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, ""How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men.""",No
9619,"They said, ""Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.""",No
9620,"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?""",No
9621,And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.,No
9622,"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women.",No
9624,Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.,No
9625,"But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.",No
9626,"My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.",No
9628,I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.,No
9631,"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.",No
9633,That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.,No
9634,"We're still down 580,000 jobs.",Yes
9636,"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.",Yes
9637,This is what I have done.,No
9638,"It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.",No
9639,And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.,No
9641,"An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.",Yes
9643,I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.,No
9645,"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?",No
9646,"He said, ""I'll get back to you.""",No
9647,And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.,No
9648,"Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.",No
9650,You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.,No
9651,I think that's a mistake.,No
9652,"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.",Yes
9653,"Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.",No
9655,This is money out of that family's pocket.,No
9657,That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.,No
9658,"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",Yes
9659,That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.,No
9660,And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.,No
9661,"When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.",No
9662,That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.,No
9663,These are not just women's issues.,No
9666,And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.,No
9669,That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.,No
9678,"I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...",No
9679,"I don't think so, Candy.",No
9682,I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.,No
9688,I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.,No
9689,And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.,No
9690,Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.,No
9691,And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.,Yes
9695,"I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.",Yes
9696,"That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.",No
9697,"Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.",Yes
9698,I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.,No
9699,It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.,Yes
9700,I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.,No
9701,"Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.",No
9703,"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.",Yes
9705,"And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.",Yes
9706,So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.,No
9707,"And then let's take the last one, championing small business.",No
9708,Our party has been focused too long.,No
9709,I came through small business.,No
9710,I understand how hard it is to start a small business.,No
9711,That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.,No
9712,I want to keep their taxes down on small business.,No
9713,"I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.",No
9714,"And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.",No
9717,And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.,No
9718,My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.,No
9721,"Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.",No
9723,But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.,Yes
9725,And the plans that I talked about will create even more.,No
9726,"But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.",Yes
9727,That's what took us from surplus to deficit.,Yes
9728,"When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.",Yes
9729,"That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.",No
9730,"And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.",Yes
9732,"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.",No
9734,And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.,No
9736,"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.",No
9737,George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.,Yes
9738,George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.,Yes
9739,He didn't call for self-deportation.,No
9740,"George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.",Yes
9741,"In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.",No
9742,And I think that's a mistake.,No
9743,That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.,No
9751,"Well, we've gone through a tough four years.",No
9752,There's no doubt about it.,No
9753,"But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.",Yes
9755,"I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.",Yes
9756,"I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.",Yes
9757,"I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.",No
9758,"I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.",Yes
9759,"I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.",Yes
9760,"We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.",Yes
9761,We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.,Yes
9762,"Now, does that mean you're not struggling?",No
9764,A lot of us are.,No
9765,"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.",No
9766,"Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.",No
9767,"All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.",Yes
9768,"And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.",No
9769,"But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.",No
9770,And I suspect he'll keep those too.,No
9771,"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, ""We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college.",No
9773,"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.""",No
9775,"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare.",No
9776,"First thing I'm going to do,"" despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well.",Yes
9778,"That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.",No
9782,...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?,No
9783,Make sure your kids can go to college.,No
9784,"Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security... (CROSSTALK)",No
9788,...will be there for you.,No
9791,I think you know better.,No
9792,I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.,No
9793,"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.",No
9794,You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.,No
9795,We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.,No
9797,The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.,Yes
9798,I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.,Yes
9799,This was the president's plan.,No
9801,"He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.",Yes
9804,He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.,No
9805,He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.,No
9807,This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.,No
9808,He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.,No
9809,He hasn't done that either.,No
9810,"In fact, he doubled it.",Yes
9811,"He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.",Yes
9812,"It's gone up by $2,500 a year.",Yes
9813,"And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.",Yes
9814,The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.,No
9815,"He keeps saying, ""Look, I've created 5 million jobs.""",Yes
9816,That's after losing 5 million jobs.,Yes
9819,"There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.",Yes
9821,"When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.",Yes
9822,"Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.",Yes
9823,How about the growth of the economy?,No
9824,"It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.",Yes
9825,The president wants to do well.,No
9827,"But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.",Yes
9828,"You might say, ""Well, you got an example of one that worked better?""",No
9830,Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.,No
9831,And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.,Yes
9832,"The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.",No
9833,He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.,No
9834,"That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.",No
9837,That's what this election is about.,No
9838,It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.,No
9845,This is for Governor Romney?,No
9858,Did I get that right?,No
9861,And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.,No
9863,We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.,Yes
9864,My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.,No
9865,We welcome legal immigrants into this country.,No
9866,I want our legal system to work better.,No
9869,I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.,No
9870,"I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.",No
9871,"People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A.",Yes
9873,"Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.",No
9875,Those who've come here illegally take their place.,No
9877,What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.,No
9878,I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.,No
9879,"So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.",Yes
9880,"The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.",No
9881,"Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.",Yes
9883,"He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.",Yes
9884,Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?,Yes
9885,What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.,No
9886,"Good, I look forward to it.",No
9887,Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.,No
9889,We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.,No
9890,People are willing to take risks.,No
9891,People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.,No
9892,But we're also a nation of laws.,No
9893,So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.,Yes
9894,"The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.",Yes
9896,They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.,No
9898,"What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.",No
9899,And that's what we've done.,No
9900,"And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.",No
9901,"Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.",No
9902,Think of this as their country.,No
9903,Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.,No
9904,And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.,No
9905,And that's what I've done administratively.,No
9906,"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, ""I will veto the DREAM Act"", that would allow these young people to have access.""",Yes
9907,"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation.""",Yes
9908,Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.,No
9909,He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.,No
9910,Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.,Yes
9912,"If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.",No
9913,"So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.",No
9914,"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, ""Well Obama didn't try.""",No
9916,I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.,No
9917,"And I said, let's fix this system.",No
9918,Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.,No
9919,"But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.",No
9924,"No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.",No
9925,I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.,Yes
9926,"I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.",No
9928,"Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.",No
9930,"Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?",No
9932,He -- he doesn't answer that question.,No
9933,He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.,No
9934,"I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.",No
9935,Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.,Yes
9936,"In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.",No
9937,I was not the standard bearer.,No
9938,My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.,No
9939,"Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.",No
9940,"What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.",No
9941,Instead let people make their own choice.,No
9942,"And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.",No
9943,But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.,No
9944,"I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.",No
9945,Let me mention something else the president said.,No
9946,"It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.",No
9960,Just going to make a point.,No
9961,Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.,No
9962,"And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.",No
9963,"Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?",No
9964,Have you looked at your pension?,No
9966,"Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?",No
9967,"You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.",No
9968,It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.,No
9969,"Well, let me give you some advice.",No
9970,I don't check it that often.,No
9971,Let me give you some advice.,No
9973,You also have investments in Chinese companies.,Yes
9974,You also have investments outside the United States.,Yes
9975,You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.,Yes
9979,I thought we were talking about immigration.,No
9981,I do want to make sure that...,No
9985,Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.,No
9986,"His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.",Yes
9988,And it's a bad policy.,No
9989,And it won't help us grow.,No
9990,"Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.",No
9991,And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.,No
9993,"Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.",No
9994,"But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...",No
9998,... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.,No
9999,And it's time for them to get serious on it.,No
10002,This used to be a bipartisan issue.,No
10017,"Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.",No
10018,"And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.",No
10019,"I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.",No
10020,I know these folks and I know their families.,No
10021,So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.,No
10022,"So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.",No
10023,"Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.",No
10024,"Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.",No
10025,"And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.",No
10026,Now Governor Romney had a very different response.,No
10027,"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.",Yes
10028,You don't turn national security into a political issue.,No
10029,Certainly not right when it's happening.,No
10030,And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.,No
10031,"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.",No
10032,"I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.",Yes
10033,"I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.",Yes
10034,"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.",Yes
10035,"And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.",No
10036,"And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.",No
10037,You know that I mean what I say.,No
10041,"And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.",No
10042,I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.,No
10044,We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.,No
10045,There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.,No
10046,"There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.",No
10047,And there was no demonstration involved.,Yes
10048,It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.,Yes
10049,"Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.",No
10050,How could we have not known?,No
10051,"But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.",Yes
10052,I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.,No
10053,We've read their accounts now about what happened.,No
10054,It was very clear this was not a demonstration.,No
10055,This was an attack by terrorists.,Yes
10056,And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.,No
10057,"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.",No
10058,"Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.",No
10059,We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.,No
10061,"The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.",No
10066,Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.,No
10067,But she works for me.,No
10068,"I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.",No
10069,"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.",No
10070,That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.,No
10071,"And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.",No
10072,"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.",No
10073,"Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.",No
10074,That's not what we do.,No
10075,"That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.",No
10079,I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.,No
10081,"You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.",No
10082,"It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?",No
10084,I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.,Yes
10092,This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.,No
10094,It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.,No
10095,"And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --",No
10100,-- this was a spontaneous --,No
10108,"I'm happy to do that, too.",No
10110,I just want to make sure that --,No
10112,#NAME?,No
10116,"We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.",No
10117,We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.,No
10118,"But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.",No
10119,Most recently out in Aurora.,No
10120,"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.",No
10121,And her son had been shot through the head.,No
10122,"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.",No
10123,But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.,No
10124,"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.",No
10125,But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.,No
10126,And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.,No
10127,Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.,No
10128,But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.,No
10129,"Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.",No
10130,They're using cheap hand guns.,Yes
10131,"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.",No
10132,And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.,No
10133,Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.,No
10134,But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.,No
10136,"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.",No
10137,"We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.",No
10138,"What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.",No
10139,And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?,No
10140,And there are a number of things.,No
10143,We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.,Yes
10144,"And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.",No
10145,But let me mention another thing.,No
10147,"We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.",No
10148,"Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.",No
10149,"A lot of great single moms, single dads.",No
10150,"But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.",No
10151,"Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.",Yes
10152,The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.,No
10153,"So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.",No
10154,The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.,No
10155,"Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.",Yes
10156,They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.,Yes
10157,And this was a -- this was a program of the government.,Yes
10158,"For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.",No
10159,But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.,No
10160,"Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.",Yes
10161,"I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.",Yes
10167,"Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.",Yes
10168,"And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.",Yes
10169,"There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.",No
10170,"That's what we need more of, Candy.",No
10171,What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.,No
10175,-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.,No
10176,I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.,No
10178,"The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.",Yes
10179,"And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.",Yes
10180,So that's on the record.,No
10181,"But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.",No
10182,We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.,No
10183,"But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.",No
10184,"And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed.",No
10185,We're starting to see gains in math and science.,Yes
10186,"When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.",Yes
10187,"And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.",No
10188,And so we're matching them up.,No
10189,Giving them access to higher education.,Yes
10190,"As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.",Yes
10200,Because -- because this is important.,No
10201,This is part of the choice in this election.,No
10202,"When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy.",Yes
10203,When -- when he was asked would class size...,No
10209,But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...,No
10211,... and reduce our violence.,No
10218,"Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right.",No
10219,The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.,Yes
10220,China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.,Yes
10221,It used to be the United States of America.,No
10222,A lot of good people have lost jobs.,No
10223,A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.,Yes
10224,That's total over the last four years.,Yes
10225,One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.,No
10226,We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.,No
10227,What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.,No
10228,This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.,No
10229,"It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.",No
10230,"Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.",Yes
10231,"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.",No
10232,"Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.",No
10234,One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.,Yes
10235,"Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.",Yes
10236,And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.,Yes
10238,And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.,Yes
10239,China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.,No
10240,"And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.",No
10241,"On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.",No
10242,So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.,No
10243,But let me -- let me not just stop there.,No
10244,"Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they -- they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.",Yes
10245,"That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here.",No
10246,Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.,Yes
10248,"So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?",No
10249,We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.,No
10251,The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.,Yes
10252,I talk to small businesses across the country.,No
10253,"They say, ""We feel like we're under attack from our own government.""",No
10254,"I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.",No
10255,And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.,No
10256,My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.,No
10257,"If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.",No
10258,The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.,Yes
10259,"I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.",No
10264,But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.,No
10265,"I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.",Yes
10266,All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.,No
10267,"Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.",Yes
10268,"One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes.",Yes
10269,"But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.",Yes
10270,"And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs.",Yes
10271,The problem is they'll be in china.,No
10274,That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.,No
10277,That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.,Yes
10278,"That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.",No
10279,"Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated.",No
10280,"In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.",Yes
10282,That's what reporters called it.,No
10283,"And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard.",Yes
10284,And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.,No
10285,That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.,Yes
10286,That's going to help to create jobs here.,No
10291,The answer is very straightforward.,No
10293,China's been cheating over the years.,No
10294,One by holding down the value of their currency.,No
10295,"Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology.",No
10296,"There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods.",No
10297,They hack into our computers.,Yes
10299,"Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business.",No
10300,That's what brings jobs in.,No
10301,The president's characterization of my tax plan...,No
10310,"Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.",No
10311,"Because they are low wage, low skill jobs.",No
10312,"I want high wage, high skill jobs.",No
10313,That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.,No
10314,That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.,No
10315,That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.,No
10316,"And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.",No
10317,If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.,No
10318,Then companies won't come here.,No
10319,"Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.",Yes
10323,Government does not create jobs.,No
10324,Government does not create jobs.,No
10334,"In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do.",No
10335,"In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.",No
10336,I care about 100 percent of the American people.,No
10339,I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.,No
10340,"I spent my life in the private sector, not in government.",No
10341,"I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.",No
10342,My -- my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.,No
10343,And I believe we're all children of the same God.,No
10344,I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.,No
10345,I -- I served as a missionary for my church.,No
10346,I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years.,No
10347,I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.,No
10348,I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.,No
10349,"And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.",Yes
10350,"I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.",Yes
10351,I understand that I can get this country on track again.,No
10352,We don't have to settle for what we're going through.,No
10353,We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.,No
10354,We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.,No
10355,We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.,No
10356,We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.,Yes
10357,We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.,Yes
10358,"If I become president, I'll get America working again.",No
10362,I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations.,No
10363,The president said he would.,No
10366,I'll get our incomes up.,No
10367,"And by the way, I've done these things.",No
10368,I served as governor and showed I could get them done.,Yes
10370,"Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.",No
10371,That's not what I believe.,No
10373,I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.,No
10374,"But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown.",No
10375,That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.,No
10376,And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.,No
10377,There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.,No
10378,I believe Governor Romney is a good man.,No
10379,"Loves his family, cares about his faith.",No
10380,"But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.",Yes
10381,Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.,No
10382,Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.,No
10383,"Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams.",No
10384,Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.,No
10385,"People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income.",No
10387,That's what I've been doing for the last four years.,No
10388,"Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.",No
10389,When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I.,No
10390,"Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.",No
10391,That was something that advanced the entire country.,No
10392,And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.,No
10393,That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.,No
10438,"I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.",No
10439,I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,Yes
10440,"And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.",No
10441,"And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.",Yes
10442,It hasn't worked out that way.,No
10443,And so now we've got to take some decisive action.,No
10444,"Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.",No
10445,We've got to make sure that works properly.,No
10446,"And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.",No
10447,It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.,No
10449,"And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.",No
10450,But that's only step one.,No
10452,And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.,No
10453,It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.,No
10454,It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.,Yes
10456,You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.,No
10460,"And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.",No
10463,"Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.",No
10466,We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much.,Yes
10470,We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington.,No
10471,"Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?",Yes
10473,"And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.",No
10474,You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.,Yes
10475,"As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.",No
10478,"But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.",No
10480,"I know how the do that, my friends.",No
10481,"And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.",No
10482,"But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.",No
10493,"You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans.",No
10495,A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.,No
10496,"He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.",No
10497,"I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.",No
10499,Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.,Yes
10500,Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.,No
10501,But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.,No
10502,"Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.",Yes
10505,"Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.",No
10506,But there are other folks out there.,No
10507,The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.,No
10509,We've got to help the middle class.,No
10510,"And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.",Yes
10511,"Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.",No
10512,"For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.",No
10515,But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.,No
10516,That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.,No
10523,"Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.",Yes
10524,"I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.",No
10525,"But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",No
10526,"I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.",No
10527,"But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.",Yes
10528,"And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this.",No
10529,We've got to stop this greed and excess.,No
10530,"Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing.",No
10532,"Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions.",No
10533,Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.,Yes
10534,"So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions.",No
10536,"That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.",No
10537,"But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire.",No
10538,There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it.,Yes
10539,There were others who took a hike.,No
10541,"Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.",No
10542,"Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.",Yes
10543,"If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.",No
10544,"If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.",No
10545,"And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.",No
10546,"So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.",No
10547,But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.,No
10548,"Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.",No
10549,"Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.",No
10550,"Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.",Yes
10551,"On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.",Yes
10552,"I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.",Yes
10553,"A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.",Yes
10554,And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.,Yes
10556,He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.,Yes
10557,And I never promoted Fannie Mae.,Yes
10558,"In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.",No
10559,"So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.",No
10560,"What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?",No
10561,This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.,No
10562,And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.,No
10563,"The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.",Yes
10564,"And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.",No
10568,"No, I am confident about the American economy.",No
10569,But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.,No
10570,"The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.",No
10571,We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.,No
10572,"But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.",No
10575,"I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.",No
10576,"My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.",No
10577,Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.,Yes
10578,The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy.,No
10580,They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.,No
10582,They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.,No
10585,They are the best workers in the world.,No
10588,And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time.,Yes
10595,"Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget.",No
10596,"If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.",No
10598,Maybe you put off buying a new car.,No
10599,That's not what happens in Washington.,No
10601,There is a lot of blame to go around.,No
10602,But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.,No
10603,"When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.",Yes
10604,And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.,Yes
10606,It's now over $10 trillion.,Yes
10609,And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.,Yes
10611,I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.,No
10612,"You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.",No
10613,We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.,No
10614,We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.,No
10616,We've got to have a different energy plan.,No
10617,We've got to invest in college affordability.,No
10618,"So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.",No
10619,"And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.",Yes
10620,"The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.",Yes
10621,We've got to put an end to that.,No
10623,"Well, Theresa (ph), thank you.",No
10624,"And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.",No
10625,And I have been a consistent reformer.,Yes
10626,"I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change.",No
10627,I have a clear record of bipartisanship.,Yes
10628,The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.,No
10631,And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.,No
10632,That's really part of your mistrust here.,No
10633,"And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.",No
10635,And you know what you'll find?,No
10636,This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.,Yes
10637,I have fought against excessive spending and outrages.,Yes
10638,I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.,Yes
10639,Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?,Yes
10641,Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?,Yes
10642,"He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.",Yes
10643,"My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?",No
10644,I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.,No
10645,"Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.",No
10646,"You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.",No
10647,And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that.,No
10648,"And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.",Yes
10655,The three priorities were health...,No
10658,"I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.",No
10660,"My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.",No
10661,"We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.",No
10662,I know how to do that.,No
10663,"I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others.",Yes
10665,We can work on nuclear power plants.,No
10666,"Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs.",No
10667,"We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.",No
10668,All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.,No
10669,"My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.",Yes
10670,"As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care.",No
10672,But we can do them all at once.,No
10673,There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.,No
10674,All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.,No
10678,"We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.",No
10679,"Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.",No
10680,"Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.",Yes
10681,"And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.",Yes
10683,That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.,Yes
10684,"Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.",No
10686,"Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.",No
10688,"Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.",Yes
10689,"And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.",No
10690,"But just one point I want to make, Tom.",No
10691,Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.,No
10693,Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.,No
10695,"I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.",No
10696,But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.,No
10697,"So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.",Yes
10698,And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.,No
10708,I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.,Yes
10709,And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.,No
10710,I know a lot of them that aren't working.,No
10711,"One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors.",No
10712,I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.,Yes
10714,"And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.",No
10715,And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.,No
10716,So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.,No
10717,"And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.",No
10718,"And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.",No
10721,We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.,No
10724,"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait.""",No
10725,"I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.",No
10728,"You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.",No
10729,"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop.""",No
10731,"And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.",No
10732,"And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.",No
10733,There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.,No
10734,I believe in the need for increased oil production.,No
10735,"We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.",No
10736,"It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.",Yes
10739,"And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.",No
10740,And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.,No
10741,And the last point I just want to make.,No
10742,"I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.",No
10743,That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.,No
10747,"Well, I think it starts with Washington.",No
10748,"We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what?",No
10749,"There's easy money out there.""",No
10750,"It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.",No
10751,"It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.",No
10752,"I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.",Yes
10754,"And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.",No
10755,"I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.",No
10756,"And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.",No
10757,That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.,No
10758,That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.,No
10759,"I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.",No
10760,That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.,No
10763,"There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.",No
10764,But he wants to raise taxes.,Yes
10765,"My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.",Yes
10766,"You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.",Yes
10767,"The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.",Yes
10768,Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.,Yes
10769,Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.,No
10770,"You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.",Yes
10772,"So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.",No
10773,"I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.",No
10774,"To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama's plan calls for.",Yes
10775,And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.,No
10776,And let's not raise anybody's taxes.,No
10778,"Tom, can I respond to this briefly?",No
10782,"The tax issue, because I think it's very important.",No
10790,"Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.",No
10791,"We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.",No
10792,"But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.",No
10793,"And you know, Senator McCain, I think the ""Straight Talk Express"" lost a wheel on that one.",No
10795,"I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.",No
10796,"If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.",Yes
10797,"If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.",Yes
10798,"Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.",No
10800,So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.,Yes
10801,"And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.",Yes
10802,"Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.",No
10804,"He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.",Yes
10807,"Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.",No
10810,"Hey, I'll answer the question.",No
10811,"Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom.",No
10816,Social Security is not that tough.,No
10817,"We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.",No
10818,We've got to sit down together across the table.,No
10820,"I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts.",Yes
10821,"That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.",No
10824,"I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.",No
10825,"So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.",No
10826,It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.,No
10827,"My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.",No
10828,Let's not let them fool with it anymore.,No
10829,There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.,No
10830,"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us.""",No
10831,"Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record.",No
10832,Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.,Yes
10835,You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?,Yes
10836,So let's look at our record.,No
10838,I have fought excess spending.,Yes
10839,I have fought to reform government.,Yes
10840,"Let's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America.",No
10841,And we'll get our economy going again.,No
10851,"Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.",No
10852,And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.,No
10853,"But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.",No
10854,"I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.",Yes
10855,"And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it.",No
10856,"That's the good news, my friends.",No
10857,The bad news is we lost.,No
10858,"But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.",No
10861,Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.,No
10862,"Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants.",No
10864,And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.,No
10865,"The Japanese, the British, the French do it.",Yes
10866,"And we can do it, too.",No
10867,Senator Obama has opposed that.,Yes
10868,"We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.",No
10869,"We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.",Yes
10871,This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.,No
10872,"And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.",No
10873,It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.,No
10875,"The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.",Yes
10876,"And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.",Yes
10877,"Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.",Yes
10878,But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.,No
10879,Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.,No
10880,"He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.",Yes
10881,What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.,No
10883,"So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.",No
10884,One last point I want to make on energy.,No
10885,"Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",Yes
10886,So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.,No
10887,And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.,No
10888,"We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.",Yes
10893,"Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.",No
10900,"I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.",No
10902,"It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.",Yes
10903,You know who voted for it?,No
10906,You know who voted against it?,No
10908,I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.,No
10909,"I vote against them, my friends.",No
10911,"But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.",No
10912,"We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.",No
10914,"We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.",No
10915,"And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.",No
10916,Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.,Yes
10917,"And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.",No
10924,"Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.",No
10925,It is breaking family budgets.,No
10926,I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.,No
10928,And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.,Yes
10929,"If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.",No
10930,So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.,Yes
10931,So here's what I would do.,No
10932,"If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.",No
10933,You can keep your choice of doctor.,No
10934,"We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.",No
10935,And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.,No
10936,We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.,No
10937,That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.,Yes
10938,"If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.",Yes
10939,"Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.",No
10940,"And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.",No
10941,"Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.",No
10942,"He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.",No
10943,What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.,Yes
10944,"So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.",No
10945,He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.,No
10946,And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.,No
10947,"In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.",Yes
10948,"That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.",No
10949,"We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.",No
10950,And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.,No
10953,You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.,No
10954,"Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.",Yes
10956,"Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.",No
10957,Let's have community health centers.,No
10960,But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.,No
10961,"As you notice, he starts talking about government.",No
10962,"He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.",No
10963,"If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.",Yes
10966,"If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you.",Yes
10968,"They can take it anywhere, across state lines.",No
10971,Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.,No
10972,"And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.",Yes
10973,"You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.",No
10975,Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.,No
10976,Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.,No
10977,Of course they all want to do that.,No
10979,"We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.",No
10983,"I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.",No
10984,"And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.",No
10985,But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.,No
10986,But it is certainly my responsibility.,No
10987,"It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.",No
10990,"But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.",No
10991,"And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.",Yes
10992,Perhaps we might find that out tonight.,No
10993,"Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.",No
10996,"Well, I think it should be a right for every American.",No
10997,"In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.",No
10999,"And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.",No
11000,"Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.",Yes
11002,You'll still have choice of doctor.,Yes
11004,Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.,No
11005,What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.,No
11006,"Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.",No
11007,"And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.",Yes
11008,"Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.",No
11009,"And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?",No
11010,"They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.",Yes
11011,That's how in banking it works.,No
11012,"Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.",Yes
11013,"And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.",No
11014,That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.,No
11015,He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.,Yes
11016,That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.,No
11017,"It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.",No
11020,I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?,No
11027,"But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.",No
11028,"I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.",No
11029,"But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.",No
11030,"My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.",No
11031,So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.,No
11032,"But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.",No
11033,"And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.",No
11034,"And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.",Yes
11035,Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.,No
11036,He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.,No
11037,"And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.",No
11038,"We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.",No
11042,There are some things I don't understand.,No
11043,"I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.",Yes
11044,That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.,No
11045,"When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.",Yes
11046,"That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.",No
11047,"So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.",No
11048,But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.,Yes
11050,"We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.",Yes
11051,"And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.",Yes
11052,"Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.",No
11053,We are a force of good in the world.,No
11054,But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.,Yes
11055,"And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.",Yes
11056,"That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.",No
11057,It has not worked for America.,No
11063,"If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.",No
11064,"So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.",No
11066,But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.,No
11067,We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.,No
11068,That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.,No
11069,Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.,No
11071,"We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.",No
11075,"If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.",No
11076,"There was a lot at stake there, my friends.",No
11077,And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.,No
11078,I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.,No
11079,"The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.",No
11082,That requires a cool hand at the tiller.,No
11083,This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.,No
11084,"We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.",No
11085,"In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?",No
11087,"Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.",Yes
11088,"So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.",No
11089,"And, again, I know those situations.",No
11090,I've been in them all my life.,No
11091,And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.,No
11092,And I may have to make those tough decisions.,No
11093,But I won't take them lightly.,No
11095,"But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.",No
11100,"Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.",No
11101,I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.,No
11102,"So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.",Yes
11103,"They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.",Yes
11104,They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.,Yes
11105,"And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.",No
11106,They are plotting to kill Americans right now.,Yes
11107,"As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.",No
11108,"So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.",Yes
11109,But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.,No
11110,"We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.",Yes
11111,"What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.",Yes
11113,We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.,No
11114,That has to be our biggest national security priority.,No
11116,"Well, Katie (ph), thank you.",No
11117,"You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt.",No
11118,"Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.",No
11119,Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.,No
11120,"In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.",No
11122,"You know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.",No
11123,"When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.",No
11124,"Now, let me just go back with you very briefly.",No
11125,"We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake.",Yes
11126,We washed our hands of Afghanistan.,No
11127,"The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.",Yes
11128,"Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.",Yes
11129,"Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.",No
11131,"We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.",No
11135,... just a quick follow-up on this.,No
11137,"If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.",No
11140,It'd be fine with me.,No
11141,It'd be fine with me.,No
11146,"Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.",No
11149,"You're doing a great job, Tom.",No
11150,"Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.",No
11151,Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.,No
11152,Senator McCain continues to repeat this.,No
11153,"What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.",Yes
11154,"Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.",No
11155,"Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.",No
11157,"Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" who called for the annihilation of North Korea.",No
11158,"That I don't think is an example of ""speaking softly.""",No
11159,"This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, ""Next up, Baghdad.""",Yes
11160,So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.,No
11161,"And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.",Yes
11162,We were not promoting democracy.,No
11163,"This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.",Yes
11164,"And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...",No
11166,... to -- to -- to...,No
11170,"I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.",Yes
11171,I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.,No
11172,I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.,No
11173,"I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.",No
11174,But the point is that I know how to handle these crises.,No
11175,"And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.",No
11176,"I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends.",No
11178,I know how to get him.,No
11179,I'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it.,No
11180,"But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Senator Obama did.",No
11181,"And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.",No
11182,"And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.",No
11192,"General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.",Yes
11193,"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.""",No
11194,I don't think he has to be a dictator.,No
11196,"But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.",No
11198,"General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.",No
11200,It is the same overall strategy.,No
11201,"Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on.",No
11202,We have to double the size of the Afghan army.,No
11205,We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.,No
11206,"But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.",No
11207,"He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.",No
11208,"And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.",Yes
11209,"So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.",No
11214,"First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.",No
11215,"But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.",No
11216,"Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.",No
11217,"I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.",No
11218,He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks.,No
11219,"He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.",No
11220,"I said before, watch Ukraine.",No
11221,"Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.",No
11222,We've got to show moral support for Georgia.,No
11223,We've got to show moral support for Ukraine.,No
11224,We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.,No
11225,"We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.",No
11226,"And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior.",No
11227,"Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.",No
11230,"It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.",No
11233,"Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.",No
11236,We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.,No
11237,But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.,No
11238,Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.,No
11239,And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.,No
11241,We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.,No
11242,"You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.",Yes
11243,"And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.",No
11244,"So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.",No
11245,We haven't been doing enough of that.,No
11246,We tend to be reactive.,No
11247,That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.,Yes
11248,"That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.",Yes
11249,We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.,No
11250,And one last point I want to make about Russia.,No
11251,Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.,No
11252,"If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.",No
11253,That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.,No
11257,I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.,No
11262,Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.,No
11263,"If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War.",No
11264,"If I say no, it ignores their behavior.",No
11265,"Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor.",No
11267,And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.,No
11268,"But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.",No
11279,"I want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer.",No
11280,"And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.",No
11282,Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council.,No
11283,I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.,No
11284,"And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat.",Yes
11285,It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel.,No
11286,It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.,No
11287,"If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too.",No
11288,The tensions will be ratcheted up.,No
11289,"What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?",No
11290,"Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions.",No
11291,"That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.",Yes
11292,"I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.",No
11294,"I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.",No
11297,"Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.",No
11298,We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.,No
11300,"Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.",No
11303,And we will never take military options off the table.,No
11304,And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.,No
11305,"It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.",No
11306,"And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.",No
11307,That starts putting the squeeze on them.,No
11308,"Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.",No
11309,"If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.",No
11310,"Now, it may not work.",No
11311,"But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.",No
11312,"When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?",No
11314,North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.,Yes
11315,"We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.",No
11323,"My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.",No
11324,"And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.",No
11325,"But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.",No
11326,It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.,No
11328,I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.,No
11329,I came from very modest means.,No
11330,"I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.",No
11331,"Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.",No
11332,The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.,No
11334,"Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.",No
11335,Wages and incomes have gone down.,Yes
11336,People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick.,No
11337,"We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.",No
11338,"And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.",No
11341,"That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.",No
11342,"But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.",No
11345,Senator Obama had the opening.,No
11348,"And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.",No
11349,The challenges that we face are unprecedented.,No
11350,Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.,No
11352,So what I don't know is what the unexpected will be.,No
11353,But I have spent my whole life serving this country.,No
11355,My mother basically raised our family.,No
11356,I know what it's like in dark times.,No
11358,I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.,No
11359,I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.,No
11360,That's what America's all about.,No
11361,I believe in this country.,No
11362,I believe in its future.,No
11363,I believe in its greatness.,No
11364,"It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.",No
11365,"And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.",No
11396,First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?,No
11397,What's in the best interests of our people?,No
11398,When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.,No
11399,Is it in our nation's interests?,No
11400,Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.,No
11401,Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.,No
11402,Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.,No
11403,I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.,No
11404,"I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.",No
11405,"I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.",No
11406,He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.,No
11407,He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.,No
11408,One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.,No
11409,I've been able to set clear goals.,No
11410,"The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.",No
11411,That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.,No
11412,So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.,No
11415,"I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.",No
11416,I see it as a question of values.,No
11417,It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.,No
11418,And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.,No
11419,"It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.",No
11420,"As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.",No
11421,So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.,No
11422,The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.,No
11423,"And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.",No
11424,"It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.",No
11425,So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.,No
11426,We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.,No
11427,And we have to keep our military strong.,No
11428,"We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.",Yes
11429,"But our real power comes, I think, from our values.",No
11432,"Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.",No
11433,I don't think they'll look at us with envy.,No
11434,It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.,No
11435,"If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.",No
11436,"If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.",No
11437,"And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble.",No
11438,And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.,No
11439,So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.,No
11440,"We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.",No
11444,"I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.",No
11445,That there is some resentment of U.S. power.,No
11446,So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.,No
11447,But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.,No
11448,We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.,No
11449,"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.",No
11450,"You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.",Yes
11451,The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.,No
11452,We need to do more.,No
11453,But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.,No
11456,"Take, for example, Third World debt.",No
11457,I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.,No
11458,"I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.",No
11459,"We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.",No
11460,We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.,No
11461,We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.,No
11462,We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.,No
11463,So we got to be guarded in our generosity.,No
11469,"The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.",No
11470,We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.,No
11471,We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.,No
11472,"I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.",No
11473,"The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.",No
11474,It's a very tense situation there.,No
11475,But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.,Yes
11476,"It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.",No
11477,Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.,No
11478,And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.,No
11479,"But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.",No
11480,Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.,No
11481,"They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.",No
11482,And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.,No
11484,"Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.",No
11485,"Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.",Yes
11486,I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.,No
11487,I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.,No
11488,I'm going to stand by Israel.,No
11489,"Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.",No
11490,It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.,No
11491,"And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.",No
11492,"The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.",No
11493,The sanctions are being violated.,Yes
11494,We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.,No
11495,He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.,No
11496,But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.,No
11497,"One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.",No
11498,"It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.",No
11499,"After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.",Yes
11500,I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.,No
11503,"Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.",Yes
11504,"And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.",No
11505,"And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.",No
11508,"I do think this, though.",No
11509,When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.,No
11510,"It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.",No
11511,"Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.",No
11512,"And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.",No
11513,This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.,No
11514,I will try to do the same thing.,No
11515,"But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.",No
11518,I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.,No
11520,"I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.",No
11522,"I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.",No
11523,"We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.",Yes
11525,We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.,No
11526,"And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.",No
11529,"Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.",No
11530,I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.,No
11531,But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.,No
11532,And we have maintained the sanctions.,Yes
11533,Now I want to go further.,No
11534,"I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.",Yes
11535,"I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.",Yes
11536,I don't think they should be allowed to.,No
11538,"No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.",No
11542,I think it's a triumph.,No
11543,I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.,No
11544,I supported them when they did so.,No
11545,"I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.",No
11546,I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.,No
11547,"Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there's a lot of work left to be done, however.",No
11550,"Yes, I think it is.",No
11552,I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.,No
11553,And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.,No
11555,I thought he made the right decision to do so.,No
11556,"I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.",No
11557,The administration deserves credit for having made it work.,No
11558,It is important for NATO to have it work.,No
11559,It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.,No
11560,"And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.",No
11561,"Now, there's more work to do.",No
11562,"Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.",No
11563,IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.,No
11564,I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.,No
11565,"Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.",Yes
11566,When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.,Yes
11567,He caused the death of so many people.,Yes
11568,He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.,Yes
11569,And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.,No
11570,"Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.",Yes
11571,He is an indicted war criminal.,Yes
11572,He should be held accountable.,No
11573,"Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.",No
11574,"In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.",No
11575,"Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.",No
11576,"But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.",No
11577,"Now, have I got that wrong?",No
11578,Trying to figure out who the questioner was.,No
11579,If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.,No
11580,"I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.",No
11581,I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.,No
11582,"I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.",No
11589,Can you run through the list again?,No
11592,I thought that was a mistake.,No
11598,"Yes, I voted for it, supported it.",Yes
11600,"Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.",No
11601,I did support it at the time.,No
11602,"It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.",No
11615,"Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.",No
11617,"And as a result, our nation paid a price.",No
11618,And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.,No
11619,I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.,No
11620,I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.,No
11621,"But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.",No
11622,I wouldn't have supported either.,No
11629,"Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.",No
11637,I think the administration did the right thing in that case.,No
11639,"It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.",Yes
11640,And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.,No
11641,"The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.",No
11643,"I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.",No
11645,"We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.",Yes
11646,"My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.",No
11647,But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.,No
11648,We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.,No
11649,"But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.",No
11650,"One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.",No
11651,"If we tried everything else, if we have allies.",No
11652,"In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.",Yes
11653,In Africa we did not.,No
11654,"Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.",Yes
11655,"We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.",No
11656,"But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.",No
11658,"Well, I understand, and Africa is important.",No
11659,"And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.",No
11660,We have to work with Nigeria.,No
11662,"But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.",No
11663,"And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.",No
11664,"I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.",No
11666,"But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.",No
11667,And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.,No
11668,I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.,No
11669,I want to be judicious in its use.,No
11671,I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.,No
11672,I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.,No
11673,"It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.",Yes
11674,"It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.",Yes
11677,I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.,No
11678,I think we have to be very reticent about that.,No
11679,"But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.",No
11680,"The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.",No
11681,"Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.",No
11682,All these other countries are looking to us.,No
11683,"Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.",No
11684,"Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.",No
11685,"This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.",No
11686,"During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.",No
11687,"The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.",No
11688,"And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.",Yes
11689,We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.,No
11690,We still have lots of troops in Europe.,No
11691,And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?,No
11694,But it was also military.,No
11695,And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.,No
11696,We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.,No
11700,First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.,No
11701,I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.,No
11702,And we can't do that.,No
11703,We've got to rebuild our military.,No
11704,But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.,Yes
11705,"And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.",No
11706,I would very much like to get our troops out of there.,No
11707,"I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.",No
11708,That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.,Yes
11709,No one is suggesting that.,No
11710,But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.,No
11711,And there is an example.,No
11713,"Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.",No
11714,I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.,No
11715,The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.,No
11720,I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.,No
11721,Maybe I'm missing something here.,No
11722,"I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?",No
11724,Our military is meant to fight and win war.,No
11725,That's what it's meant to do.,No
11726,"And when it gets overextended, morale drops.",No
11727,"I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.",No
11728,"And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.",No
11729,"It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.",No
11730,I don't disagree with that.,No
11731,"I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.",No
11732,That's what we did in Haiti.,No
11733,There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.,Yes
11734,"And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.",No
11735,That's really about all we can do.,No
11736,"But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.",No
11737,"And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.",No
11738,"And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.",No
11739,I certainly agree with that.,No
11740,And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.,No
11741,"I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.",Yes
11742,I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.,No
11743,We've had some disagreements about that.,No
11744,"He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.",Yes
11745,But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.,No
11746,And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.,No
11751,"Well, I mentioned Third World debt.",No
11753,"That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.",No
11754,"I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.",No
11755,I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.,No
11756,"I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.",No
11757,"One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.",Yes
11758,"I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.",No
11759,It needs to be available for emergency situations.,No
11760,I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.,No
11761,But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.,No
11762,So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.,No
11763,I just want to make sure the return is good.,No
11765,"No, I would make some changes.",No
11766,I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.,No
11767,"I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.",No
11768,And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.,No
11769,"The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.",No
11770,The governor mentioned it earlier.,No
11771,I've worked on this issue.,No
11772,"It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.",No
11773,And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.,No
11774,"I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.",No
11775,"The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.",No
11776,And we have a fundamental choice to make.,No
11777,"Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.",No
11778,And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.,No
11779,"I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.",No
11780,"Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.",No
11781,It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.,No
11782,Let me comment on that.,No
11783,I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.,No
11785,"And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.",No
11786,I want to empower the people.,No
11787,"I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.",No
11788,"I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â I think we can help.",No
11789,I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.,No
11790,"But take Russia, for example.",No
11791,"We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.",Yes
11792,The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.,No
11793,They're going to have to make the decision themselves.,No
11794,"Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.",No
11795,But Russia has to make the decision.,No
11796,"We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.",No
11797,"So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â Now, we trust freedom.",No
11798,"We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.",No
11799,"But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.",No
11802,Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.,No
11807,"The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.",No
11808,I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.,No
11809,I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.,No
11810,And I know it's been going on a long time.,No
11811,In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.,Yes
11812,But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.,No
11813,And I was surprised at the extent of it.,No
11814,And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.,No
11815,"Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.",No
11816,"Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.",No
11817,And it's not an easy problem to solve.,No
11818,"But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.",No
11819,"Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.",No
11820,"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.",No
11821,And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.,No
11822,"One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.",No
11823,"I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.",No
11824,"I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.",No
11825,"But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.",No
11826,I don't think they ought to be held guilty.,No
11827,"But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.",No
11828,"And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.",No
11833,"And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.",No
11834,"I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.",No
11835,"And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.",No
11836,And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.,No
11837,"And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.",No
11838,And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.,Yes
11839,And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.,No
11840,I think these crimes are different.,No
11841,"I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.",No
11846,We've got one in Texas.,No
11848,"The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?",No
11849,They're going to be put to death.,Yes
11850,A jury found them guilty.,Yes
11851,It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.,No
11852,And it's the right cause.,No
11854,"Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.",No
11855,Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.,Yes
11856,"People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.",No
11857,"My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.",Yes
11858,So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.,No
11859,It's an issue throughout our society.,No
11860,"And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.",No
11861,"I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.",No
11864,"It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.",No
11867,Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.,No
11868,In public education when we just move children through the schools.,No
11869,"My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.",No
11870,She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.,No
11871,"She said, reading is the new civil right.",No
11873,"And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.",No
11875,It starts with making sure every child learns to read.,No
11876,K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.,No
11877,Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.,No
11878,"Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.",No
11879,"I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.",No
11880,We can do better in our public schools.,No
11881,"We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.",No
11882,"One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.",No
11883,"Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?",No
11885,Is anybody being discriminated against?,No
11886,"It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.",No
11887,"And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.",No
11888,"And if they are, fine.",No
11889,"And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.",No
11890,And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.,No
11891,There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.,No
11893,"Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.",No
11894,I think we still need affirmative action.,No
11895,"I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.",Yes
11896,The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.,No
11897,"But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.",No
11901,"Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.",No
11902,Am I wrong about that?,No
11903,"Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?",No
11905,I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --,No
11906,"No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas.",Yes
11907,"And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.",Yes
11910,"In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.",No
11912,And they got the ultimate punishment.,Yes
11913,I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.,No
11914,We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.,No
11917,I don't want to jump in.,No
11918,"I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.",Yes
11919,"There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.",No
11920,"And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.",No
11921,"There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.",Yes
11922,And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.,Yes
11926,"I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.",No
11927,"But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.",No
11928,That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.,No
11929,"But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.",No
11930,And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.,No
11931,And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.,No
11932,And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.,No
11937,I'm not for gay marriage.,No
11938,I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.,No
11939,And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.,No
11940,I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.,No
11941,But I think marriage is a sacred institution.,No
11942,I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.,No
11943,I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.,Yes
11944,"I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.",No
11945,But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.,No
11947,"I agree with that, and I did support that law.",No
11948,"But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.",No
11949,And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.,No
11951,I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.,No
11952,"I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.",No
11953,I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.,No
11954,I'm not sure where he's coming from.,No
11955,But I will be a tolerant person.,No
11956,I've been a tolerant person all my life.,No
11957,I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.,No
11960,"I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.",No
11961,"Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.",Yes
11963,What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.,Yes
11964,And it would be a federal law preventing that.,No
11965,"Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress.",Yes
11966,I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.,No
11970,"Well, I have no idea.",No
11971,"I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.",No
11972,"I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.",No
11973,"As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.",No
11974,"I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life.",No
11976,And I think that's the way it ought to be.,No
11977,"But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.",No
11979,"Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.",No
11980,"That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.",No
11983,"Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.",No
11984,"But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.",No
11985,I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.,No
11986,I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.,No
11987,"The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.",No
11988,I think these assault weapons are a problem.,No
11989,So I favor closing the gun show loophole.,No
11990,"In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.",Yes
11992,"If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.",No
11993,I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.,No
11994,I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.,No
11995,Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.,Yes
11996,I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.,No
11997,I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.,No
11998,Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.,No
11999,I think that measures like these are important.,No
12000,"Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.",No
12002,"Well, it starts with enforcing law.",No
12003,"When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you.",No
12004,"If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.",No
12005,"If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.",No
12006,And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.,No
12007,Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.,Yes
12008,And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.,No
12009,And I'm going to make it a priority.,No
12010,"Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.",No
12011,That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.,Yes
12012,One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.,No
12013,In Texas I tried to do something innovative.,No
12014,There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.,Yes
12016,"But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.",No
12017,So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.,Yes
12018,I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.,No
12019,I disagree with the vice president on this issue.,No
12020,He is for registration of guns.,Yes
12021,"I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.",No
12022,"The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.",No
12024,It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.,No
12025,An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.,No
12028,"Well, I'm not for registration.",No
12029,I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.,No
12032,"like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --",No
12040,"I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.",No
12041,There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.,Yes
12042,"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that.",No
12043,"But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.",No
12044,I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.,No
12045,"Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.",No
12046,"The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.",No
12047,That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.,No
12050,"Well, I'm not for photo licensing.",No
12051,Let me say something about Columbine.,No
12052,"Listen, we've got gun laws.",Yes
12053,He says we ought to have gun-free schools.,Yes
12055,I'm sure every state in the union has got them.,Yes
12056,You can't carry a gun into a school.,No
12057,And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.,No
12058,But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.,No
12059,It's really a matter of culture.,No
12060,It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.,No
12061,Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?,No
12062,"So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.",No
12063,"Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.",No
12064,So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.,No
12065,And we can enforce law.,No
12066,"But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.",No
12067,But there's a larger law.,No
12068,Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.,No
12069,And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.,No
12070,I also believe in the Golden Rule.,No
12071,And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.,No
12072,We do have a serious problem in our culture.,No
12073,Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.,Yes
12074,She's worked on it longer than I have.,No
12075,But I feel very strongly about that.,No
12076,"And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.",No
12077,But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.,No
12078,But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.,No
12079,"I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.",No
12080,And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.,No
12081,"And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.",No
12082,"Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.",No
12083,"Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.",No
12084,What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.,No
12085,So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.,Yes
12088,We believe in tough love.,No
12089,"We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.",No
12090,And that's what needs to happen.,No
12092,"If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.",No
12098,"Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.",No
12099,It's to make health care affordable and available this way.,No
12100,"First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.",No
12103,"Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.",No
12104,"For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.",No
12105,"In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.",No
12106,"One, we need more community health centers.",No
12107,I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.,Yes
12108,These are places where people can get primary care.,No
12109,Secondly -- and they're good.,No
12110,They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.,No
12111,"Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.",Yes
12112,It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.,No
12113,"If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.",No
12114,"And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.",Yes
12115,I think that's the very best way to go.,No
12116,"It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.",No
12118,"It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.",No
12119,"I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.",No
12120,"In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.",Yes
12121,I want a smaller and smarter government.,No
12122,"I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.",Yes
12123,"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.",Yes
12124,So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.,No
12125,But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.,No
12126,I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.,No
12127,So it's one of my top priorities.,No
12128,"Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.",No
12129,"And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.",No
12130,And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.,Yes
12131,"49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.",Yes
12132,So it is a priority for me.,No
12134,"I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.",No
12135,I think it ought to be a top priority.,No
12137,"First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?",No
12138,I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.,Yes
12139,It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.,No
12140,"Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.",Yes
12141,"Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.",Yes
12142,"Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.",Yes
12143,It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.,No
12144,But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.,No
12146,"We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.",Yes
12147,"For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.",Yes
12148,"You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.",No
12149,"We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.",Yes
12151,"Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.",Yes
12152,"And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.",Yes
12153,"And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.",Yes
12154,"He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.",Yes
12155,There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.,No
12156,There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.,No
12158,"600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.",Yes
12162,"If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.",No
12164,And they get health care.,Yes
12165,"Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.",No
12166,"But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.",Yes
12167,"He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.",Yes
12168,"And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.",Yes
12169,Let me just tell you who the jury is.,No
12171,"There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.",Yes
12172,"And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.",Yes
12173,So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.,No
12174,I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.,No
12175,We come together both Republicans and Democrats.,No
12179,But it's not a statement about his heart.,No
12180,I don't claim to know his heart.,No
12181,I think he's a good person.,No
12182,I make no allegations about that.,No
12183,I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.,No
12184,I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.,No
12185,But I think it's about his priorities.,No
12186,"And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?",No
12188,"Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.",No
12189,"Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.",Yes
12190,According to his own numbers.,No
12191,"So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.",No
12192,It's a question of priorities and values.,No
12195,"First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.",No
12196,"And secondly, I repeat to you --",No
12198,That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.,Yes
12199,The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.,No
12200,The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.,Yes
12201,"And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",Yes
12202,"That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.",Yes
12203,We just have a different point of view.,No
12204,It's a totally different point of view.,No
12205,He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.,Yes
12206,I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.,No
12207,"Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.",No
12209,I can't emphasize to you how much.,No
12210,I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.,Yes
12211,The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.,Yes
12212,We're working hard to sign up children.,No
12213,"We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.",Yes
12214,We're making really good progress.,No
12215,And our state cares a lot about our children.,No
12216,My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.,No
12217,"These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.",No
12218,They have not done it.,Yes
12219,They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.,No
12220,And they have not got it done.,Yes
12221,"And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.",No
12222,The horse is up here now.,No
12223,"But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.",No
12229,I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.,No
12230,There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.,Yes
12231,Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.,No
12232,And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.,Yes
12233,"Now, here is the good news, Jim.",No
12234,"If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.",No
12235,You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.,No
12236,They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.,No
12237,"Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.",Yes
12238,And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.,No
12239,I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.,No
12240,We have to be bold.,No
12241,We have to provide leadership.,No
12242,Now it's true that we disagree on this.,No
12243,The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.,Yes
12244,He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.,Yes
12245,Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country.,Yes
12247,We have a very different outlook.,No
12248,"And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.",No
12250,"Well, let me start with Texas.",No
12251,We are a big industrial state.,Yes
12252,We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.,Yes
12253,"We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.",Yes
12254,Our water is cleaner now.,Yes
12256,A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.,Yes
12257,And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.,No
12258,"I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.",No
12259,"The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.",Yes
12260,"And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.",No
12261,I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.,No
12262,I think we need to have clean coal technologies.,No
12263,I propose $2 billion worth.,No
12264,"By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.",Yes
12265,And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.,Yes
12266,We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.,No
12267,"Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.",Yes
12270,"In other words, there are practical things we can do.",No
12271,But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.,Yes
12272,"If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.",No
12273,People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.,No
12274,"Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.",No
12277,"I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.",No
12278,He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.,Yes
12279,I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.,No
12280,"And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.",No
12281,"We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.",No
12282,We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.,No
12283,I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.,No
12284,We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.,No
12286,I think it's a fundamental difference.,No
12287,Let me give you an example.,No
12293,"Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.",No
12294,"I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.",No
12295,"And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.",No
12296,"The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President.",Yes
12297,That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.,No
12298,I think there's a difference.,No
12299,"I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --",No
12301,"Out in the west, yeah.",No
12302,And so -- on the logging issue.,No
12303,That's not the way I would have done it.,No
12304,Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.,No
12305,But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.,No
12307,"Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable.",No
12308,So long as people have input.,No
12310,I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.,No
12311,But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.,No
12312,And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.,No
12313,I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.,No
12314,Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.,No
12315,China and India were exempted from that treaty.,Yes
12316,"I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.",Yes
12320,"Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.",Yes
12321,But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.,Yes
12322,I'm not for command and control techniques either.,No
12323,"I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.",Yes
12324,But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.,No
12325,I think that we do.,No
12326,"It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.",Yes
12327,"Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.",Yes
12328,What are we going to tell our children?,No
12330,I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.,No
12331,"In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, ""Where your heart is, there is your treasure also.""",No
12332,And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.,No
12334,"I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?",No
12335,A profound scientist recently made a different --,No
12339,I've been trying so hard not to.,No
12346,"That's an interruption, by the way.",No
12350,"I apologize, Mr. Vice President.",No
12354,Of course they care about them.,No
12355,"Oh, you mean the rules.",No
12359,"I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.",No
12360,"But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions.",No
12361,"And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.",No
12362,"And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.",No
12363,We may have different approaches.,No
12364,We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.,No
12365,I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.,No
12366,"And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.",No
12367,I feel very strongly the same place.,No
12368,"It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.",No
12376,"Well, we all make mistakes.",No
12377,"I've been known to mangle a syl-a-ble or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean.",No
12378,I think credibility is important.,No
12379,"It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.",No
12380,"And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.",No
12382,"I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.",Yes
12383,I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.,Yes
12384,I mention the last debate --,No
12386,"The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.",No
12388,"A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?",No
12389,"Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't.",No
12390,And so I think this is an issue.,No
12391,I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.,No
12392,I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.,No
12393,But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.,No
12394,And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.,No
12395,"Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.",Yes
12396,"That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.",No
12397,And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.,No
12398,That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.,No
12400,"I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.",Yes
12401,And I'm going to try to do better.,No
12402,One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.,No
12403,"However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.",Yes
12404,"There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.",Yes
12405,More sometimes than people in foreign countries.,No
12406,And we need to do something about that.,No
12407,Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.,Yes
12409,And that means doing it under the Medicare program.,No
12410,I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.,No
12411,"I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.",No
12412,"But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.",No
12414,"That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?",Yes
12416,Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.,No
12418,I hope they're not awful things.,No
12419,I think they may be using the man's own words.,No
12421,I don't believe I've used those words.,No
12429,I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.,No
12432,"The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?",No
12433,You haven't seen the commercial?,No
12435,"I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.",Yes
12436,I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.,No
12437,That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.,No
12439,"Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.",No
12442,"Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.",No
12443,"This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.",No
12444,"And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country.",No
12445,"I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.",No
12446,"I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.",No
12447,"The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there.",No
12448,Because I want to give new choices to parents.,No
12449,"To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year.",Yes
12450,I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.,No
12451,"For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers.",No
12452,And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.,No
12453,"I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.",Yes
12454,I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.,No
12455,"Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.",No
12456,"If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.",No
12457,"If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education.",Yes
12460,"I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.",No
12462,"Jim, thank you very much.",No
12463,"Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening.",No
12464,I'm running to get some things done for America.,No
12465,There's too many issues left unresolved.,No
12466,"There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.",No
12467,I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.,No
12468,"I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability.",No
12469,No child should be left behind in America.,No
12470,I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.,No
12471,I worry about morale in today's military.,No
12472,The warning signs are clear.,No
12473,"It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.",No
12474,"Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare.",No
12475,This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.,No
12476,It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.,No
12477,I want to do something about Social Security.,No
12478,"It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept.",No
12479,"But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money.",No
12480,"And finally, I do believe in tax relief.",No
12481,I believe we can set our priorities.,No
12482,"I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government.",No
12483,I believe in limited government.,No
12484,"By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.",No
12485,"I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.",No
12487,"I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.",No
12511,"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.",No
12512,Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.,No
12513,I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.,No
12514,"There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.",No
12515,"And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?",No
12516,How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?,No
12517,"Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?",No
12518,Who threatens freedom in the world?,No
12519,There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.,No
12520,"And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.",No
12522,I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.,No
12523,"I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.",No
12524,"First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.",No
12525,"In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.",Yes
12526,And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.,Yes
12527,"In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.",Yes
12528,"We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.",Yes
12529,"Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?",No
12530,I think there're several reasons.,No
12531,"In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.",No
12532,One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.,Yes
12533,"In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.",No
12534,They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.,Yes
12535,We learned from their mistakes.,No
12536,"And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.",Yes
12537,We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.,Yes
12538,"But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.",No
12539,"That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.",No
12541,Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?,No
12542,"Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.",No
12543,It encourages them to begin a war.,No
12544,"And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.",No
12545,Let us move now to the future.,No
12546,"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.",No
12547,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.",No
12548,"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.",Yes
12549,"They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.",No
12550,We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.,No
12551,"In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.",No
12552,It has grown in the past seven years.,Yes
12553,It can and will grow even more in the next four.,No
12554,And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.,No
12555,We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.,No
12556,"And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.",No
12559,Again we turn to the past.,No
12560,"Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.",No
12561,"When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.",No
12562,And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.,No
12563,But all this by itself is not enough.,No
12564,"It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.",No
12565,We must have a great goal.,No
12566,"And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.",No
12567,To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.,No
12569,"And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.",No
12570,"We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.",No
12572,"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.",No
12573,First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.,No
12575,I have sustained it since then.,Yes
12576,I've said that I agree with the Administration policy.,No
12577,"Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.",Yes
12578,"I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.",Yes
12580,"In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.",No
12581,So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.,No
12582,"It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.",Yes
12583,Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.,No
12584,The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?,No
12585,Is our relative strength growing?,No
12586,"Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low?",No
12587,I don't believe it is.,No
12588,I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.,No
12589,"And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.",No
12590,"I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",No
12592,I talked to the American Ambassador there.,No
12593,He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.,No
12594,"And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done.",Yes
12595,Our d- security depends upon Latin America.,No
12596,"Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil?",No
12597,"At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.",No
12598,It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.,No
12599,Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?,Yes
12600,"Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?",Yes
12601,Africa is now the emerging area of the world.,No
12602,It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.,Yes
12603,We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.,Yes
12604,"In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.",Yes
12605,If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.,No
12607,"We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.",Yes
12608,"We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.",Yes
12610,We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.,No
12611,"Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?",No
12612,"That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.",No
12614,What are freedom's chances in those areas?,No
12615,"By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?",No
12616,"Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?",Yes
12617,Will the Congo go Communist?,No
12621,Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it?,No
12622,Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?,No
12626,The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?,No
12627,Is our strength and prestige rising?,No
12628,Do people want to be identified with us?,No
12629,Do they want to follow United States leadership?,No
12630,"I don't think they do, enough.",No
12631,And that's what concerns me.,No
12632,In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.,No
12633,"On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.",Yes
12634,The rest either abstained or voted against us.,Yes
12635,More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.,Yes
12636,"I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.",No
12637,I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.,No
12638,I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.,No
12639,I have seen us ignore Africa.,No
12640,There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations.,Yes
12641,There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.,Yes
12642,"When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.",Yes
12643,We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.,Yes
12644,I believe that the world is changing fast.,No
12645,"And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.",No
12646,The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.,Yes
12647,"The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done.""",No
12648,"And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.",No
12649,I think we're going to have to do better.,No
12650,Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.,No
12652,"But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.",Yes
12653,"They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.",Yes
12654,I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.,No
12655,He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.,No
12657,"What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.",No
12658,"And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.",Yes
12659,We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.,Yes
12660,I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.,No
12661,The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them.,Yes
12662,And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A.,Yes
12663,"The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.",No
12667,We want to be stronger.,No
12668,We want freedom to gain.,No
12669,But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.,No
12670,"I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.",No
12671,I think we have to revita1ize our society.,No
12672,"I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.",No
12673,"And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.",No
12679,Our policies are very different.,No
12680,I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.,No
12681,"In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.",Yes
12682,Now let's just see what this means.,No
12683,"We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.",Yes
12684,"The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.",Yes
12685,"Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.",No
12686,"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.",No
12688,"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.",No
12689,This is the major recommendation that he's made.,Yes
12691,"Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.",No
12692,There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.,No
12694,The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.,No
12695,We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.,Yes
12696,"We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.",Yes
12697,We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.,No
12698,"By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.",Yes
12699,"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.",No
12700,Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.,No
12702,"There isn't any doubt about that, number one.",No
12703,"Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.",No
12704,They have to include the other countries of Latin America.,No
12705,"The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.",No
12706,If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.,Yes
12707,"That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.",No
12708,"Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.",No
12709,"The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.",No
12710,"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.",No
12711,His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.,No
12712,His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.,Yes
12713,"You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.",Yes
12720,"Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.",No
12721,This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.,No
12722,The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.,Yes
12723,This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.,No
12724,There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.,No
12725,I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.,No
12726,"I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.",No
12727,"The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.",No
12728,"The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.",No
12729,Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.,No
12730,"I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.",No
12731,I'm asking the people's support as president.,No
12732,We will select the best man we can get.,No
12733,"But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.",No
12735,"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.",No
12737,"If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.",No
12738,Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.,No
12739,"I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.",Yes
12740,"We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.",No
12741,Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.,Yes
12742,"Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.",No
12747,"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.",No
12748,"Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.",No
12749,"First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.",Yes
12751,"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.",No
12752,"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?",Yes
12753,"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.",No
12754,Well let me make one thing clear.,No
12755,"Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.",No
12756,Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.,Yes
12757,And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.,No
12758,"Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.",No
12759,Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.,No
12760,Let's look at the vote on Hungary.,No
12761,There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.,Yes
12762,Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.,No
12763,Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?,No
12766,"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",No
12768,I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.,No
12769,I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.,No
12770,"I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.",No
12771,"What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.",No
12772,Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.,No
12773,The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.,No
12774,"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.",No
12775,I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.,No
12776,"Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.",No
12777,I said we had too many slums.,No
12778,"And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.",No
12779,I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.,Yes
12781,"And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.",No
12782,"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.",No
12783,"Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.",Yes
12784,"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.",No
12785,"We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.",No
12790,"Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.",No
12792,"If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.",No
12793,"Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.",No
12794,So one more effort should be made.,No
12795,I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.,No
12796,"They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.",Yes
12797,But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.,No
12798,"If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.",No
12799,I hope we can succeed.,No
12800,"But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.",No
12801,I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.,No
12802,There may be testing in outer space.,No
12803,I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.,No
12804,It's possible to detect those kind of tests.,No
12805,The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.,No
12806,So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.,No
12807,If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.,No
12808,But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.,No
12809,"China may have it by 1963, Egypt.",No
12810,"War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.",No
12811,We ought to make one last effort.,No
12814,"I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.",Yes
12815,"As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.",Yes
12816,I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.,No
12817,"I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.",No
12818,"I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.",No
12819,There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.,No
12820,"But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.",No
12821,I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.,No
12822,"I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.",No
12827,"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.",No
12828,"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.",No
12830,"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.",No
12831,Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.,No
12833,"Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.",No
12834,But let's look at the other side of the coin.,No
12835,"If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.",No
12836,We do not help it.,No
12837,"We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.",No
12838,"I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.",No
12839,"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.",No
12840,"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.",No
12841,"Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.",No
12842,"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",No
12844,"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.",No
12845,He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.,No
12846,He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.,No
12847,"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.",Yes
12848,"I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.",No
12849,"In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.",No
12850,The Soviet Union does understand strength.,No
12851,"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.",No
12852,"If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.",No
12853,And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.,No
12854,"But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.",No
12855,"I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.",No
12856,"I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.",No
12861,"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.",No
12862,"I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.",Yes
12863,We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.,Yes
12864,But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.,Yes
12865,I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.,No
12866,"We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.",Yes
12867,We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.,Yes
12868,I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.,No
12869,"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.",No
12870,"They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.",No
12871,"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.",No
12872,"If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.",No
12873,"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.",No
12874,India started from about the same place that China did.,No
12875,Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.,No
12876,India under a free society has been making some progress.,Yes
12877,"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.",No
12878,"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.",No
12879,This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.,No
12880,It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.,No
12881,They want to be free.,No
12882,And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.,No
12883,"They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.",No
12884,"And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.",No
12886,We can put the Communists on the defensive.,No
12888,"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.",No
12889,"Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.",No
12890,"And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.",Yes
12891,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.,No
12892,In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.,No
12893,"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.",No
12894,I would just like to s- add this one point.,No
12895,"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.",No
12896,"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",No
12897,"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.",No
12903,I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.,No
12904,He says he supports the President's position.,Yes
12905,He says that he voted for the resolution.,Yes
12906,Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.,Yes
12907,"But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.",Yes
12908,"He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.",Yes
12909,He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.,No
12910,"Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.",No
12911,"Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.",No
12912,"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",No
12913,I support the President's position.,No
12914,I have always opposed drawing a line.,Yes
12915,"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.",No
12916,And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.,No
12917,"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution.""",No
12918,"Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.",Yes
12919,"But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.",Yes
12920,It's very simple for him to clear it up.,No
12921,He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.,No
12924,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.",No
12925,"The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.",Yes
12926,"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.",Yes
12927,The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.,Yes
12928,"I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.",Yes
12929,"General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.",No
12930,"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.",No
12931,Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.,Yes
12932,Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.,No
12933,"Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.",No
12934,"And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.",Yes
12936,"In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.",No
12937,"That's not the position you took, however.",No
12938,"The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.",Yes
12939,Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.,No
12940,You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.,Yes
12941,And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.,Yes
12943,And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.,Yes
12947,I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.,No
12948,I served it uh - in the war.,No
12950,"If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.",No
12951,"But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.",No
12952,"My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.",No
12953,Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.,Yes
12954,We had a recession in fifty-eight.,No
12955,We had a recession in fifty-four.,No
12956,We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.,No
12957,We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.,No
12958,"If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.",No
12959,"And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.",No
12960,"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",No
12961,"And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.",No
12962,Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.,No
12963,Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.,No
12964,"If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?",No
12965,Why didn't we bring students over here?,No
12966,Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?,No
12967,That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.,Yes
12968,I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.,No
12969,"It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.",Yes
12970,"And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.",No
12971,"He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.",No
12972,I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.,No
12973,We can no longer afford to be second best.,No
12974,"I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.",No
12975,"I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.",No
12976,I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.,No
12977,"I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.",No
12978,And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.,No
12979,Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.,No
12980,I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.,No
12981,"And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.",No
12983,"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.",No
12984,America is not standing still.,No
12985,It has not been standing still.,No
12986,"And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.",No
12988,We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.,Yes
12989,We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.,Yes
12991,More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.,Yes
12992,He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.,No
12993,We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.,Yes
12995,He's been in some other country.,No
12996,Let's get that straight right away.,No
12997,"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.",No
12998,America has not been standing still.,No
12999,But America cannot stand pat.,No
13000,"We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.",No
13001,"We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.",No
13004,It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.,No
13005,It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.,No
13006,It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.,No
13007,"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.",No
13008,"We had a good neighbor policy, yes.",No
13010,But let's look at it.,No
13011,There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.,Yes
13012,There are only three left.,Yes
13014,Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.,Yes
13015,Not one of them selected a Communist government.,Yes
13016,All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.,Yes
13017,"Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?",No
13018,Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?,No
13020,"What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.",No
13021,We're on the side of freedom.,No
13022,"We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.",No
13023,But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.,No
13024,"Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.",Yes
13025,One other point I would make: what could you do?,No
13026,Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.,No
13027,And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.,No
13028,"What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?",No
13029,"It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.",No
13030,"It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.",No
13031,"In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.",No
13032,"And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.",No
13033,"See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.",No
13080,"Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.",Yes
13081,That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.,Yes
13082,I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.,No
13083,It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.,No
13084,And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.,No
13085,We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.,No
13088,"As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.",Yes
13090,"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.",No
13091,I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.,No
13092,I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.,No
13093,There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.,Yes
13094,I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.,No
13095,But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.,No
13096,We had a war when we came into power in 1953.,Yes
13097,We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.,Yes
13098,"We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.",No
13099,"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.",No
13105,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.",No
13106,"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.",Yes
13107,"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.",No
13108,"I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.",No
13109,This is the history of dealing with dictators.,No
13110,This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.,No
13111,We tried this with Hitler.,No
13113,"He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted.",No
13114,Now what do the Chinese Communists want?,No
13115,They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.,No
13116,"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.",No
13117,"It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?",No
13118,"I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?",No
13119,"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",No
13123,"The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.",Yes
13124,"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.""",Yes
13125,"Now, that is the issue.",No
13126,I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.,No
13127,I support it and the Pescadores Island.,No
13128,That is the present American position.,No
13130,Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.,Yes
13131,"I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.",No
13132,"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.",No
13133,"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.",Yes
13134,The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.,Yes
13135,They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.,Yes
13136,We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.,Yes
13137,"This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.",No
13143,"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.",No
13145,"It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.",No
13146,"Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.",No
13147,"There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.",No
13150,"And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake.",No
13151,"One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.",Yes
13152,"Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.",Yes
13154,The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.,No
13155,We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.,No
13156,It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.,No
13157,"But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.",No
13159,"If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.",No
13160,"But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.",No
13163,"I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it.",No
13164,"There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.",No
13165,It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.,No
13166,It's a question of who they are.,No
13167,This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.,Yes
13168,"We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.",No
13169,And I just want to make one thing very clear.,No
13170,"Yes, we should make a great effort.",No
13171,But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.,No
13172,There must be an absolute guarantee.,No
13173,"Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.",No
13174,"He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.",Yes
13175,"And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.",Yes
13181,"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.",Yes
13182,"There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.",Yes
13183,"Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question.",No
13184,"As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.",Yes
13185,"Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.",No
13186,"So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.",No
13188,"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.",No
13190,We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.,No
13191,"We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.",No
13192,"That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.",Yes
13193,"And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.",Yes
13194,The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.,No
13195,"And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.",No
13196,The road to war is always paved with good intentions.,No
13197,"And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.",No
13200,I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.,No
13201,"In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.""",Yes
13202,That was done with much thought and deliberation.,No
13203,"Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.",Yes
13204,I completely sustained the treaty.,Yes
13207,"What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.",Yes
13208,I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.,No
13209,Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.,Yes
13210,General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.,No
13211,"General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take.",Yes
13212,"To me that concept is completely repugnant.""",No
13213,So I stand with them.,No
13214,"I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.",No
13215,"I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.",No
13216,I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.,No
13217,But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.,No
13218,"Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",Yes
13224,"Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.",No
13225,They may - are not my style.,No
13226,"But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.",No
13227,"Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.",No
13228,I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.,No
13229,If you'd pass that message on to him.,No
13232,"Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.",No
13233,"I just do want to say one thing, however.",No
13234,We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.,No
13235,"But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.",No
13236,One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.,No
13237,"I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.",No
13238,"I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.",No
13239,"It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.",No
13240,"And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.",No
13241,"And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: ""Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.""",No
13247,"Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.",No
13248,Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.,No
13249,I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.,No
13250,"As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.",No
13251,"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.",Yes
13252,"Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.",Yes
13253,I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.,No
13254,"I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.",No
13255,"I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.",No
13256,"And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.",No
13257,The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.,No
13258,"Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.",No
13259,What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.,No
13260,"Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.",Yes
13261,"Now, why did they reject it?",No
13262,"For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.",No
13264,Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.,No
13266,"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina.""",Yes
13267,The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.,Yes
13268,"Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.",No
13270,"U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.",No
13271,"I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.",Yes
13272,I never suggested espionage should stop.,No
13273,"It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.",No
13274,"Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.",Yes
13275,"Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.",No
13276,That's not the position he's taking.,Yes
13277,"He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.",No
13278,He didn't take that position on Tibet.,Yes
13279,He didn't take that position on Budapest.,Yes
13280,He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.,No
13281,Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.,Yes
13282,I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.,No
13283,"But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.",Yes
13284,"And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.",No
13285,He's extending the Administration's commitment.,Yes
13292,"Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.",No
13293,"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.",No
13296,I would disagree with it.,No
13297,"Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.",Yes
13298,And that's my view now.,No
13299,I disapprove of the issue.,No
13300,I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.,No
13302,Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.,No
13304,We can't settle for anything but the best.,No
13305,"And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.",No
13306,And that means that we can't have any test of religion.,No
13307,We can't have any test of race.,No
13308,It must be a test of a man.,No
13309,Also as far as religion is concerned.,No
13310,I have seen Communism abroad.,No
13311,I see what it does.,No
13312,Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.,No
13313,We must not be divided on this issue.,No
13314,The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.,No
13315,"I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.",No
13316,We cannot have it in our hearts.,No
13317,But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.,No
13321,"Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.",No
13323,"Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.",No
13324,"Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.",No
13325,"He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.",Yes
13326,"I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.",Yes
13327,I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.,No
13328,"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.",No
13329,"I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.",No
13330,One last point I should make.,No
13331,The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.,No
13332,"We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.",Yes
13333,"And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.",No
13334,"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.",No
13335,We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.,No
13337,"Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.",No
13338,I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.,Yes
13339,"I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.",Yes
13340,I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.,Yes
13341,I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.,No
13342,"I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.",No
13343,One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.,No
13345,"By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.",No
13347,He can set up a fact-finding committee.,No
13348,The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.,No
13349,"He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.",No
13350,This is a difficult and sensitive matter.,No
13351,"But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.",No
13352,"He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.",Yes
13358,"Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.",Yes
13359,"The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.",No
13360,"On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.",Yes
13362,We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.,Yes
13363,"Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.",Yes
13364,"I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.",No
13365,"Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.",No
13366,"Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.",Yes
13368,"So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.",No
13369,"But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.",No
13370,"Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.",No
13372,Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.,No
13373,"I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.",No
13374,"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't.""",No
13375,"Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.",Yes
13376,But Social Security is a tax.,No
13378,It comes right out of your paycheck.,No
13379,This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.,No
13380,He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.,Yes
13381,"Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.",Yes
13382,And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.,Yes
13383,Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?,No
13384,I don't think we should have that kind of a program.,No
13385,Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.,No
13386,"Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.",No
13387,We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.,Yes
13392,"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.",No
13393,"I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.",No
13394,"Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.",Yes
13395,Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.,No
13397,"It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.",No
13398,"Now, what do we do about it?",No
13399,"And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.",No
13400,So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.,No
13401,"In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.",No
13402,"I refer, for example, to distressed areas.",No
13404,We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.,No
13405,"That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.",No
13406,"And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.",No
13407,"Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.",No
13409,Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.,No
13410,He's been traveling in some other country.,No
13412,We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.,No
13413,"But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.",No
13415,"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.",No
13417,The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.,Yes
13418,"Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.",Yes
13419,The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.,Yes
13420,"And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.",No
13421,But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.,No
13422,The Vice President suggested a number of things.,No
13423,He suggested that we aid distressed areas.,No
13424,The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.,Yes
13425,He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.,No
13426,But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.,Yes
13427,"And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.",Yes
13428,This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.,Yes
13429,"And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.",No
13430,Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.,Yes
13431,The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.,Yes
13432,Many say four and a half per cent.,No
13433,The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.,Yes
13434,That's why we don't have full employment today.,No
13441,"Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.",No
13442,I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.,No
13443,That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.,No
13444,We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.,No
13446,Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.,No
13447,Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.,No
13448,Particularly some of the smaller producers.,No
13449,They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.,Yes
13450,"But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.",No
13451,"And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.",Yes
13452,"I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.",No
13454,Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.,No
13455,I favor the present depletion allowance.,No
13456,"I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.",No
13457,Why do we have a depletion allowance?,No
13458,"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.",No
13459,"If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.",No
13460,"Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.",No
13461,"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.",No
13464,He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.,No
13465,"He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.",No
13466,"I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.",Yes
13468,I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.,No
13476,"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.",No
13477,"That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.",No
13478,"Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.",No
13479,And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.,Yes
13480,This one must be stepped up.,No
13481,"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.",No
13482,Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.,No
13483,I think we have been right in carrying it.,No
13484,I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.,No
13485,"But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.",Yes
13486,They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.,No
13487,"That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.",No
13488,The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.,No
13489,"We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.",No
13491,"Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.",No
13492,What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.,No
13493,"If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.",No
13494,Now on the question of gold.,No
13495,"The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.",No
13496,"In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.",No
13497,"We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.",No
13498,We have to be able to compete in the world market.,No
13499,We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.,No
13500,"In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.",Yes
13501,"Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.",Yes
13503,We have to be sure to maintain that.,No
13504,"We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.",No
13508,"Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.",No
13509,"And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.",No
13510,"Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.",No
13511,There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.,No
13512,"Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.",Yes
13513,He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.,Yes
13514,"And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.",No
13515,"Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.",Yes
13516,Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.,Yes
13517,"This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.",No
13518,"Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.",Yes
13519,"And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.",Yes
13520,"Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.",Yes
13522,A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.,Yes
13523,"On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.",Yes
13524,"The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.",Yes
13526,"Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.",Yes
13527,Laos is moving in that direction.,Yes
13528,So I would say our prestige is not so high.,No
13529,No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.,No
13530,No longer do we give an image of vitality.,No
13532,"Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.",No
13533,Let's look at the other side of the coin.,No
13534,"Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.",Yes
13535,Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.,No
13536,We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.,No
13537,Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.,No
13538,"We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.",No
13539,"We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.",No
13540,"And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.",No
13541,"I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.",Yes
13542,"In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.",No
13543,"Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.",No
13544,Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.,No
13592,"There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.",Yes
13593,"The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.",Yes
13594,"Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.",No
13595,"But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.",No
13596,"It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.",No
13597,I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.,No
13598,"I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.",Yes
13600,"Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.",No
13602,"On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.",Yes
13603,I don't believe trickle down economics will work.,No
13605,Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.,No
13606,I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.,No
13608,Do I have 1 minute?,No
13609,Just the ground rules here.,No
13612,"Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.",Yes
13613,The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.,Yes
13614,And what I don't like is trickle down government.,No
13615,"And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more.",No
13616,"Government -- he says invest government, grow government.",No
13618,"If they do, they're make-work jobs.",No
13619,It's the private sector that creates jobs.,Yes
13620,"And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much.",Yes
13621,And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.,No
13623,I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.,No
13624,It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.,No
13625,But not by raising taxes.,No
13626,"Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.",Yes
13627,So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.,No
13628,I do not want any more trickle down government.,No
13630,I want to do something about that.,No
13632,"The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget.",Yes
13633,"If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.",No
13634,Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.,No
13635,"If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.",No
13636,And we are bleeding arterially.,No
13637,"There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.",No
13638,We have spent their money.,Yes
13639,We've got to pay it back.,No
13640,"This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.",No
13641,My plan balances the budget within 6 years.,Yes
13642,We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.,No
13643,We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.,No
13644,"But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.",No
13645,The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.,No
13646,"You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.",No
13647,"I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.",No
13654,I disagree with both of them.,No
13655,"For one thing, let me just follow up here.",No
13656,I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.,No
13657,His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.,Yes
13658,"And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.",Yes
13659,"And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.",Yes
13660,He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.,Yes
13661,"And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.",Yes
13662,"Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years.",Yes
13663,"So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.",No
13664,"Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?",No
13666,"Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?",No
13668,But look what's happened to the middle class.,No
13669,Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.,Yes
13670,The tax burden on them has not gone down.,Yes
13672,"I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.",No
13673,The answer is to invest and grow this economy.,No
13674,That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.,No
13676,I think everybody's paying too much taxes.,No
13677,He refers to one tax increase.,No
13678,"Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.",Yes
13679,And I said I make a mistake.,No
13680,"If I make a mistake, I admit it.",No
13681,That's quite different than some.,No
13682,But I think that's the American way.,No
13683,"I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.",No
13685,And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.,No
13686,"We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?",No
13687,"They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.",Yes
13688,We don't want to go back to that.,No
13689,"And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.",No
13691,"Well, the record in Arkansas.",No
13692,"I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?",No
13693,"Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.",Yes
13695,But in almost every category they're lagging.,Yes
13696,I'll give you an example.,No
13697,He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.,No
13698,"Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.",Yes
13699,"On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.",Yes
13700,"You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.",No
13701,And I'm going to do that.,No
13702,"It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.",No
13703,So we've got to do that.,No
13704,I gotta get it in perspective.,No
13706,"Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.",Yes
13708,"Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.",Yes
13710,"4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.",Yes
13711,Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.,Yes
13712,Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.,Yes
13713,"We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.",Yes
13714,We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.,Yes
13715,"We're low spending, low tax burden.",Yes
13716,We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.,Yes
13717,I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.,No
13719,I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.,No
13720,Let's put it in perspective.,No
13722,It's a fairly rural state.,No
13723,"It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.",No
13724,So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.,No
13729,"No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.",No
13732,"I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.",No
13734,"Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.",Yes
13735,"And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.",No
13736,I think it's been pretty impressive.,No
13738,And the people who have jobs --,No
13740,The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.,No
13741,"I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.",No
13742,"Well, you think it's relevant.",No
13744,"Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.",Yes
13745,"I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.",Yes
13746,And we almost had it done.,No
13747,"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!""",No
13748,"One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.",Yes
13749,"What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.",No
13750,I want the line-item veto.,No
13751,"I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.",No
13752,"And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.",No
13753,That's what we call a sequester.,No
13754,"That's the discipline we need, and I'm working for that -- to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.",Yes
13759,"Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.",No
13760,I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.,No
13761,But I don't think it's fair.,No
13762,I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.,No
13764,I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.,Yes
13765,"And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.",No
13766,I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.,No
13767,I've been speaking out since day 1.,No
13768,"We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.",No
13769,"And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.",Yes
13770,"And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.",Yes
13772,"I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.",Yes
13773,What was the other part of it?,No
13776,I don't think that's true at all.,No
13777,"I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.",No
13779,"I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --",No
13781,"Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.",No
13782,"See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?",No
13783,And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.,No
13794,I will let the American people decide that.,No
13795,I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.,No
13798,"The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.",Yes
13799,"He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.",Yes
13800,"I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.",No
13801,Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.,No
13802,I will deal with them from day 1.,No
13803,"They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.",No
13805,"Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term.",No
13806,"But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.",No
13807,You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.,No
13808,"Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.",Yes
13809,The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.,Yes
13810,We've cut it in half.,Yes
13811,And all you hear about is how bad things are.,No
13812,"You know, remember the question, are you better off?",No
13813,"Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?",No
13814,Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?,No
13816,Is the guy out of work better off?,No
13817,"Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.",No
13818,You've got to free up the private sector.,No
13819,You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.,No
13820,"For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.",Yes
13821,"Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.",No
13822,And it's blocked by the Congress.,Yes
13823,"And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.",No
13830,I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.,No
13831,I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.,Yes
13832,"They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.",No
13833,"Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.",Yes
13834,Our government is that point now.,No
13835,"The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.",No
13836,"If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.",No
13837,So the General Motors experience is relevant.,No
13838,"At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.",No
13839,I sold them my remaining shares.,No
13841,I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.,No
13842,But let's take my life in perspective.,No
13843,"Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.",No
13844,"When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.",Yes
13845,"And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.",No
13846,Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.,Yes
13847,"Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.",No
13848,I could have rationalized it.,No
13849,"We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.",Yes
13850,"And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.",No
13851,"Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.",No
13852,And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.,No
13853,"Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.",No
13854,"But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.",No
13855,"And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.",Yes
13856,I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.,Yes
13857,"Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.",Yes
13858,"I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.",No
13861,I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.,No
13862,"I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.",No
13863,"I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.",No
13864,"And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.",No
13865,"Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.",No
13866,They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.,No
13867,"We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.",No
13868,We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.,No
13869,So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.,No
13870,"But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.",No
13871,That's one of the things I want to change.,No
13872,I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.,No
13873,"We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.",Yes
13877,"Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.",No
13878,That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.,No
13879,"As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.",No
13880,"I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.",No
13881,"And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.",No
13882,"And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.",No
13883,I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.,Yes
13884,"But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.",Yes
13885,There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.,No
13886,You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.,No
13887,So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.,No
13890,Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.,No
13891,They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.,Yes
13892,"I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.",Yes
13893,I think that should be a goal.,No
13894,I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.,Yes
13895,The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.,Yes
13896,I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.,No
13897,And let me say this.,No
13898,"I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.",No
13899,That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.,No
13900,"Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.",No
13901,It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.,Yes
13902,"In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.",Yes
13903,But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.,No
13904,We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.,No
13905,That's another way to improve the environment.,No
13908,"Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.",No
13909,"Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.",No
13910,"And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.",No
13911,"You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.",Yes
13912,We've got to proceed very carefully on that.,No
13913,"See, there's a lot I don't understand.",No
13915,I do understand creating jobs.,No
13916,I do understand how to make things work.,No
13917,And I got a long history of doing that.,Yes
13918,"Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.",No
13920,Everybody says it'll create jobs.,No
13921,"Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.",Yes
13922,"Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.",No
13923,One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.,No
13924,"Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.",No
13925,"And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.",Yes
13926,"We haven't got 12 days, folks.",No
13927,We cannot lose those jobs.,No
13928,"They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.",Yes
13929,"Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?",No
13930,Let's think it through here.,No
13932,"I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.",No
13933,"I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.",No
13935,"Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.",No
13936,"I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --",No
13938,"I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?",No
13940,"No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.",No
13941,"Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.",No
13943,"If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.",Yes
13944,"Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.",No
13945,Millions and millions of people at work.,No
13947,I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.,No
13948,"Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.",Yes
13949,I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.,Yes
13950,"My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.",No
13951,"Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.",No
13952,"When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.",No
13953,And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.,Yes
13954,"Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?",No
13955,You have a differential in wages right now.,Yes
13956,I just have an honest philosophical difference.,No
13957,I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.,No
13958,"I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.",No
13959,"And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.",No
13962,I'd like to respond to that.,No
13963,"You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.",Yes
13964,"Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.",No
13965,I am the one who's in the middle on this.,No
13966,Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.,Yes
13967,Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.,Yes
13968,"I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.",No
13969,I have a realistic approach to trade.,No
13970,"I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.",No
13971,But it can sure be made better.,No
13972,"Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.",Yes
13973,"If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?",No
13974,Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.,No
13975,I want to change it.,No
13978,I think he made my case.,No
13979,"On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.",No
13980,You can't do that as president.,No
13981,"You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.",No
13982,This is my point tonight.,No
13983,We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.,No
13984,And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.,No
13986,"And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.",No
13987,Right now we heard it.,No
13990,He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.,Yes
13993,That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.,No
13994,"His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.",No
13995,I believe we can be better.,No
13996,"I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.",No
13997,I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.,No
13998,"And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.",No
13999,He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.,Yes
14001,He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --,No
14002,But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.,No
14003,"I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim.",No
14004,"Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.",No
14005,"I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.",No
14008,Is there an equal time rule tonight?,No
14010,Or do you just keep lunging in at will?,No
14011,"I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.",No
14012,Is that the way it works?,No
14016,"Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.",No
14021,"I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.",No
14022,Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.,Yes
14023,We don't have free trade.,No
14024,Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.,Yes
14025,"And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.",No
14026,"Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.",Yes
14027,I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.,No
14028,"And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.",No
14029,"But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.",No
14030,"Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on.",Yes
14031,"I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.",Yes
14032,And it goes on and on.,No
14033,And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.,No
14034,They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.,Yes
14035,What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?,No
14036,"Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.",No
14037,I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.,No
14038,"I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.",Yes
14043,Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.,Yes
14044,And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.,No
14046,And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.,No
14047,I don't agree with that.,No
14048,"But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.",Yes
14049,"I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.",Yes
14050,"Could be wrong, but I think so.",No
14051,"And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.",No
14055,But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.,No
14056,The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.,Yes
14057,"If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.",No
14059,"We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.",Yes
14060,And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.,No
14061,"But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.",Yes
14062,This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.,No
14063,One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.,Yes
14064,We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.,No
14065,"If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight.",No
14066,All these things take a few minutes.,No
14067,But that's happening as we sit here today.,No
14068,"We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.",Yes
14069,"And never forget, they've got Airbus over there, and it's a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe.",No
14070,They're dying to get the commercial airline business.,No
14071,Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.,Yes
14072,"I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.",No
14073,And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.,No
14077,"Why, I had a great response to that.",No
14080,I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.,No
14081,We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.,No
14082,"And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.",No
14084,We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.,Yes
14085,We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.,No
14086,But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.,No
14087,Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.,Yes
14088,What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.,No
14089,And we're in real trouble on that.,No
14092,I promise it's less than 10 seconds.,No
14094,I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.,No
14095,"Productivity in this country is up, it is way up -- productivity is up.",No
14096,And that's a good thing.,No
14097,"There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.",No
14100,Now give me 1 second...,No
14103,"Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests.",No
14105,"Now, Jim, let me get it out.",No
14106,"On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.",Yes
14107,"I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.",No
14108,"That's kind of pathetic I have to do it -- and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention.",No
14111,"But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.",No
14112,"If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?",No
14125,If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.,No
14126,"You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.",No
14127,"Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.",No
14128,I was opposed to the war.,Yes
14130,"I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time.",No
14131,It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.,No
14132,"President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime.",Yes
14133,"We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt.",Yes
14134,So the answer is I could do that.,No
14135,I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.,No
14136,"I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.",No
14142,"Well, I've expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country, when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying.",No
14143,My argument with him on -- the question was about the draft -- is that there's this same pattern.,No
14144,"In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.",No
14145,On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.,Yes
14146,They have not been forthcoming.,No
14147,He got a deferment or he didn't.,No
14148,He got a notice or he didn't.,No
14149,"And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft.",No
14150,"A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft.",No
14152,"And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.",No
14153,That's my big difference with him on the draft.,Yes
14154,It wasn't failing to serve.,No
14159,I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.,No
14160,I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.,No
14161,"I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.",No
14162,Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.,No
14163,That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way.,No
14164,I look on this as history.,No
14165,"I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.",No
14173,I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.,No
14174,I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.,No
14175,I did it for the very reasons you say.,Yes
14176,"There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.",Yes
14177,"One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.",Yes
14178,"We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.",No
14179,"But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.",Yes
14180,I see no evidence that it has done it.,No
14181,So what would I have done?,No
14182,What should I have done?,No
14183,"I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.",No
14184,"So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.",No
14185,"I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it because I thought it was right.",No
14186,And I made a mistake.,No
14187,That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.,No
14188,That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.,No
14189,I thought it would be better for the country than it was.,No
14193,101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.,No
14194,Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.,No
14195,Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.,Yes
14197,Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.,No
14198,This was not a way to pay down the deficit.,No
14199,This was a trick on the American people.,No
14201,Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.,No
14202,"If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.",Yes
14203,"If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.",No
14204,"If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.",Yes
14206,"Now, leaders will always make mistakes.",No
14207,"We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.",No
14213,"The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was.",No
14215,"Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.",No
14216,The choices were not good then.,No
14217,"I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.",No
14218,That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.,Yes
14219,"I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.",No
14220,I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.,No
14221,"He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.",No
14222,"The real mistake was the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place.",No
14223,You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.,No
14229,You're talking about 2 different subjects.,No
14230,"In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.",No
14231,We can't get anything done.,No
14232,"How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.",Yes
14233,And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.,No
14234,You've got to go to the people.,No
14235,"I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.",No
14236,I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.,No
14237,"The point is, they'll get to decide what to think.",No
14239,"I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details.",No
14240,"See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won't watch it.",Yes
14242,You want to have a new program in this country.,No
14243,"If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.",No
14244,And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.,No
14245,"Now, I think that's going back to where we started.",No
14246,That's having a government from the people.,No
14247,"I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.",No
14250,"Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.",No
14251,And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.,No
14252,"And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.",Yes
14253,"I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president.",Yes
14254,But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.,No
14255,"Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.",Yes
14256,And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.,Yes
14258,"That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.",No
14261,I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press.,No
14262,"My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.",No
14264,And I just had to work that in.,No
14267,I'm going to pay for this later on.,No
14268,"Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.",No
14269,"Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.",Yes
14270,"But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.",No
14271,And it's hard to build a consensus.,No
14272,"We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.",Yes
14273,"Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.",Yes
14274,A president can't do that.,No
14275,Sometimes he has to act.,No
14276,"And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.",No
14277,"We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.",Yes
14284,You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.,No
14289,I happen to think she's a key person.,No
14290,I think our Cabinet members are key people.,No
14291,"I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.",No
14293,You talk about somebody strong.,No
14295,"Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.",Yes
14296,"Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello.",No
14297,You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.,No
14299,"Yeah, I plead guilty to that.",No
14301,But look who's around with him there.,No
14302,"I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.",No
14303,"We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.",Yes
14304,"What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.",Yes
14305,And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.,No
14306,"We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.",No
14307,Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?,No
14308,I think we're making progress here.,No
14309,You got a lot of women running for office.,No
14310,"As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --",No
14312,-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.,No
14313,"But nevertheless, they're out there.",No
14314,And we got some very good Republican women running.,Yes
14315,So we're making dramatic progress.,No
14317,"Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men.",No
14318,So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.,Yes
14319,"One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer.",No
14321,"And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines.",No
14322,"But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time.",No
14324,"And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.",No
14325,"We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.",Yes
14326,"I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.",No
14327,They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.,Yes
14328,"Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.",No
14329,"We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.",Yes
14330,"And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?",No
14331,I've got reply on that.,No
14332,That gets to the national honor.,No
14333,"We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.",Yes
14334,"Well, where are the papers?",No
14339,-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.,Yes
14341,"If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.",No
14342,And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.,No
14343,They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.,No
14344,"And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.",Yes
14345,"We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?",No
14346,I'd like to see those written instructions.,No
14351,When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.,No
14356,I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I'm sorry.,No
14357,I just couldn't let it stand.,No
14359,"Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.",Yes
14361,But I think even more relevant is my record at home.,No
14362,For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.,Yes
14363,An African American was my chief cabinet officer.,No
14364,An African American was my chief economic development officer.,No
14366,"There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.",No
14367,"The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.",Yes
14368,So that's what I'll do as president.,No
14369,"I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.",No
14380,"They're not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person.",Yes
14381,"And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.",No
14382,And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.,No
14383,They investigated every single one of my children.,Yes
14385,They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.,No
14386,"They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.",No
14387,And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.,Yes
14388,"So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.",No
14389,This goes on night and day.,No
14390,"I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.",No
14391,One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form.,No
14392,It's a sick art form.,No
14393,"Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.",No
14394,We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.,Yes
14396,"We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.",Yes
14398,Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.,No
14399,"And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing.",No
14400,"Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.",Yes
14401,So I say this is very simple.,No
14402,"Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.",Yes
14403,"We later said no, that's not true.",Yes
14404,"I said well, this is simple.",No
14405,What were her written instructions?,No
14406,"We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.",No
14407,"Now, I say whose country is this?",No
14409,Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?,No
14410,"The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.",No
14411,Nobody did any of this with evil intent.,No
14412,I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.,No
14413,"Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.",No
14415,"Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.",Yes
14416,And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.,Yes
14417,It was a remarkable event.,No
14418,But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.,No
14419,"In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.",Yes
14420,"All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.",Yes
14421,Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.,Yes
14422,"But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.",Yes
14423,So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.,Yes
14425,"Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.",No
14426,We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.,Yes
14427,All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.,No
14428,"And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.",No
14429,"And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.",Yes
14430,"And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.",Yes
14431,"And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.",Yes
14432,And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.,No
14433,"And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.",No
14434,"Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.",Yes
14436,"And so I just have to say, it's fine.",No
14437,"You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.",No
14438,"Come on, that's not leadership.",No
14446,"Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.",Yes
14447,"On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.",No
14448,"The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.",Yes
14449,"Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.",No
14450,The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.,Yes
14451,"I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.",No
14452,"We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.",Yes
14453,We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.,No
14454,And that will be my policy.,No
14455,"And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.",No
14456,"It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.",No
14458,"Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.",No
14460,There are some problem banks out there.,No
14461,"But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.",No
14462,And I have proposed that.,No
14463,"And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.",No
14464,"But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.",No
14466,"Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.",No
14467,The whole problem came up in 1984.,Yes
14468,The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.,Yes
14469,"These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.",No
14470,"Now, in 1984 they were told.",No
14471,I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.,No
14472,"Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.",Yes
14473,"Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.",Yes
14474,And they buried it till right after the election.,Yes
14475,"Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.",Yes
14476,"Now, if that's true, just tell me now.",No
14477,"I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.",No
14478,But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.,No
14479,I say that to both political parties.,No
14480,"The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.",No
14486,The debt and the deficit.,No
14487,"Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it.",No
14488,"And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.",No
14489,"A shameless plug there, Mr. President.",No
14490,But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.,No
14491,We have a government that doesn't work.,No
14492,"All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.",No
14493,We have a government that doesn't work.,No
14494,"It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.",No
14495,The people need to take their government back.,No
14496,"You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.",No
14497,We've got to turn this thing around.,No
14498,And it's a long list of specific items.,No
14499,And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.,No
14500,But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.,No
14501,Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress?,No
14502,Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?,No
14503,"I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?",No
14504,I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.,Yes
14505,And I'm paying for all that for those guys.,Yes
14506,"I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I'm going to show how much they've increased this little stuff they do for themselves.",No
14507,"And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.",No
14508,"Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.",No
14509,"You say, how can I get Congress to do that?",No
14510,"I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.",No
14511,We've turned the country upside down.,No
14515,"I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress.",No
14516,I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.,Yes
14517,"But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.",Yes
14518,"Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.",No
14519,"That, however, is not my only passion.",No
14520,The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.,No
14521,"My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.",No
14523,We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.,No
14524,Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.,No
14532,"Well, how about this for a government reform policy?",No
14533,Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.,No
14534,Term limits for members of the US Congress.,No
14535,Give the government back to the people.,No
14536,Let's do it that way.,No
14537,The president has term limits.,No
14538,Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.,No
14541,And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?,No
14542,"Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.",Yes
14544,And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?,No
14546,How about a line item veto?,No
14548,"And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.",No
14550,That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill.,No
14551,Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.,No
14552,"Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.",No
14553,Line item veto -- there's a good reform program for you.,No
14562,My plan -- you can read my plan.,No
14563,"My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.",Yes
14564,"Now, I'll tell ya this.",No
14565,I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.,No
14566,"If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.",No
14567,I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.,No
14568,"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country.",No
14569,"And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.",Yes
14570,"So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up.",No
14571,But I can tell you this.,No
14572,I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended.,No
14574,And you know how you can trust me about that?,No
14575,"Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news.",No
14576,"He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.",Yes
14578,I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.,No
14579,The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.,No
14580,"I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.",No
14583,That's what worries me --,No
14585,-- that he's going to be responsible.,No
14586,He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.,No
14587,He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.,No
14588,We do not want to be the lowest of the low.,No
14589,We are not a nation in decline.,No
14591,We are a rising nation.,Yes
14592,"Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.",No
14593,"He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich.",Yes
14594,"To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600.",No
14595,"And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man.",No
14596,"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet.",No
14597,"Lock your wallet because he's coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.",Yes
14598,"Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.",No
14601,"Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.",Yes
14602,What about the honor of my state?,No
14603,"We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.",Yes
14604,And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.,No
14605,And I have to defend the honor of my state.,No
14610,So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?,No
14614,I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.,No
14616,"Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.",No
14618,"I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.",No
14619,"You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.",No
14620,"If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.",No
14622,What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.,No
14623,"Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.",No
14624,The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.,Yes
14625,"And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.",Yes
14626,"So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.",No
14627,"I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.",No
14628,"And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.",No
14629,And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.,No
14636,"Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.",No
14637,Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.,No
14638,"Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.",No
14639,It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.,No
14640,"We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.",No
14641,"And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.",No
14642,"On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.",No
14643,"But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.",No
14644,They're almost at the bottom on every single category.,Yes
14645,We can't do that to the American people.,No
14646,"And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.",Yes
14647,And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.,No
14648,It doesn't work that way when you're president.,No
14651,And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.,No
14653,"It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.",No
14654,So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.,No
14655,"And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.",No
14656,And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.,No
14657,Also I got a philosophical difference.,No
14658,I got to watch the clock here.,No
14660,The whole world has had economic problems.,No
14661,We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.,Yes
14662,And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.,No
14664,That's why I think I'll win.,No
14667,"I'm the last one, right?",No
14672,I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.,No
14673,I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.,Yes
14674,"I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.",Yes
14675,"So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.",No
14676,"And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.",Yes
14677,"Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?",No
14678,They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.,No
14679,We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.,Yes
14680,Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.,No
14681,It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.,No
14683,"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed.",Yes
14684,"But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.",No
14685,They don't want us talking about each other.,No
14686,They want us to talk about the problems of this country.,No
14687,"I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.",Yes
14688,Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.,No
14689,High tech executives in Northern California.,Yes
14690,"Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.",Yes
14691,"Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.",Yes
14692,"We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.",No
14700,"First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.",No
14701,I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.,No
14702,I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.,No
14703,They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.,No
14704,"I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.",No
14705,"I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.",No
14706,I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.,No
14707,I just believe it's time to change.,No
14708,I offer a new approach.,No
14709,It's not trickle down economics.,No
14710,It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.,Yes
14711,"More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.",Yes
14713,And it's not tax and spend economics.,No
14714,"It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.",No
14715,That is my commitment to you.,No
14716,It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.,No
14717,"I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.",No
14718,I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.,No
14719,I know we can do better.,No
14720,"It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.",No
14724,"Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.",No
14725,"On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.",No
14726,"I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.",No
14727,"On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.",No
14729,We're living in an interconnected world.,No
14730,The whole world is having economic difficulties.,Yes
14731,The US is doing better than a lot.,No
14732,But we've got to do even better.,No
14733,"And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?",No
14734,"And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.",No
14736,Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.,No
14737,"And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.",No
14738,"And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?",No
14739,"I need your support, I ask for your vote.",No
14740,And may God bless the US of America.,No
14743,"To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.",No
14744,These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.,No
14745,"This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.",No
14746,"Now, the question is, can we win?",No
14747,"Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.",No
14748,Question really is who do you want in the White House.,No
14750,"Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.",No
14754,"The ""we"" is you and me.",No
14755,"You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.",No
14756,"And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.",No
14757,Together we can get anything done.,No
14758,The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.,No
14759,"Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.",Yes
14760,"Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?",No
14761,Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.,No
14762,I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.,No
14763,Who's the best person to manage money?,No
14764,I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.,No
14765,Who's the best person to get results and not talk?,No
14766,Look at the record and make your decision.,No
14767,"And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?",No
14768,"And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?",No
14769,"Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.",No
14771,"To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.",No
14809,"I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.",No
14810,I do know what he has said about mine.,No
14811,"And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.",No
14812,"Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.",No
14813,"Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.",No
14814,And to maintain that peace requires strength.,No
14815,America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.,No
14816,"We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.",Yes
14817,And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.,No
14818,I have seen four wars in my lifetime.,No
14819,I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.,No
14820,"I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.",No
14825,"Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government.",No
14826,"spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.",No
14827,And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.,Yes
14828,I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.,No
14829,"In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.",No
14836,"Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.",No
14837,"And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.",No
14838,I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.,No
14839,I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.,No
14840,H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.,No
14841,It would be neat and plausible and wrong.,No
14842,"The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.",Yes
14843,"Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.",Yes
14844,"Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense.",Yes
14845,But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.,No
14846,"We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.",No
14847,"In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.",Yes
14848,"This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.",No
14849,I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.,No
14850,"There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.",No
14851,"That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.",No
14852,That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.,No
14858,"Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.",Yes
14859,"In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.",No
14860,Now we have two major carrier task forces.,Yes
14861,We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.,Yes
14862,"And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.",No
14863,"But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.",No
14864,"This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.",No
14866,"Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.",Yes
14867,"I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.",Yes
14868,"I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.",Yes
14869,"Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",Yes
14871,"Well, there are various elements of defense.",No
14872,"One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.",No
14873,Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.,No
14874,"I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.",No
14875,"In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.",No
14876,"But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.",No
14877,"Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.",No
14887,Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.,No
14888,"In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.",Yes
14889,We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.,Yes
14891,The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.,Yes
14893,"Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.",Yes
14894,It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.,Yes
14895,"In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.",Yes
14896,"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.",Yes
14897,I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.,No
14898,"which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.",Yes
14900,"So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.",No
14901,"So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.",No
14909,"We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well.",No
14910,"As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.",Yes
14912,"At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.",Yes
14913,"Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.",Yes
14914,"The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.",No
14915,"And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.",Yes
14916,"This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.",Yes
14923,"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.",No
14924,"When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.",Yes
14927,President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.,No
14928,"Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.",Yes
14929,"But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.",Yes
14931,"And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.",Yes
14932,"Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.",No
14934,We have inflation because the Government is living too well.,No
14935,"And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.",Yes
14936,I see my time is running out here.,No
14938,"Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.",No
14939,And my economic plan calls for that.,No
14940,The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.,Yes
14941,But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.,No
14949,"most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.",No
14950,I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.,No
14951,"As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.",Yes
14952,We've had the Central Accounting.,Yes
14953,"Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.",Yes
14954,"We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.",No
14955,I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.,Yes
14956,And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.,Yes
14958,"Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.",No
14959,He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.,Yes
14960,I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.,Yes
14961,"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.",Yes
14962,"This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.",No
14963,In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.,Yes
14970,"The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.",Yes
14971,The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.,Yes
14972,"And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",No
14979,"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.",No
14980,"Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.",No
14981,"And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.",No
14982,"The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.",Yes
14983,"And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.",No
14984,I think there are things to do in this regard.,No
14985,I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.,No
14986,You have to see it to believe it.,No
14987,"It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings.",No
14988,"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair.""",No
14989,And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.,Yes
14990,"There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.",No
14991,"And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.",Yes
14992,"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?",No
15004,"I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.",No
15005,"I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth.",No
15006,"But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.",No
15008,"And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.",No
15009,And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.,No
15016,"When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.",No
15017,"We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.",No
15018,This has been a very successful effort.,No
15019,That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.,Yes
15020,"Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.",Yes
15021,"We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.",No
15022,"Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.",Yes
15023,We also are pursuing housing programs.,No
15024,We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.,Yes
15025,"These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.",No
15026,It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.,No
15028,I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country.,Yes
15029,Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.,No
15030,"We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.",No
15038,"Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.",No
15039,"Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength.",No
15040,"In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.",Yes
15041,"Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.",Yes
15042,"I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.",Yes
15043,To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.,No
15046,"The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.",No
15047,"But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.",No
15048,They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.,No
15049,"Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.",No
15050,"I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.",No
15051,"And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people.",Yes
15052,"And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.",No
15053,"With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.",Yes
15055,It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.,No
15056,"We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.",No
15057,"In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.",Yes
15058,"This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.",No
15059,"There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.",No
15066,"Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.",No
15067,"At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.",No
15068,Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.,Yes
15069,"There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.",Yes
15070,"Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.",No
15071,Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons.,Yes
15072,"In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.",Yes
15073,"When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.",No
15074,"And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.",No
15075,"This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.",No
15081,We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.,No
15082,"We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.",No
15083,"When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.",Yes
15091,"Barbara, you've asked that question twice.",No
15092,I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.,No
15093,I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.,Yes
15094,"Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?",No
15095,"And I said, well, yes.",No
15096,"And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?",No
15097,"These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.",No
15098,"I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?",No
15099,"First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.",No
15100,"Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they're coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.",No
15101,"What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?",No
15102,And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.,No
15103,"In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.",No
15109,"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.",No
15110,And we've been guilty of that.,No
15111,"Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.",Yes
15112,"I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all - the Soviet Union.",No
15113,"Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.",Yes
15114,"And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.",Yes
15117,I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.,Yes
15118,"What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers.",Yes
15119,"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.",No
15120,"Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.",No
15121,"And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.",No
15122,"These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.",No
15126,"And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.",No
15127,"I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.",Yes
15143,"I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.",No
15144,"And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time.",Yes
15145,The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.,Yes
15146,"And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.",No
15147,"But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.",Yes
15148,The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.,No
15150,It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.,Yes
15151,"Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.",Yes
15152,"Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.",Yes
15153,And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.,No
15163,"Yes, I'd be glad to.",No
15165,"unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.",No
15168,"He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.",Yes
15169,The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.,No
15170,"There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.",Yes
15171,"It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.",No
15172,"You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.",No
15173,"But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",No
15175,"Yes, I'd like to respond very much.",No
15176,"First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.",No
15177,"And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.",Yes
15178,"Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.",Yes
15179,I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.,Yes
15180,I am not talking of scrapping.,No
15181,"I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.",No
15182,"And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.",No
15183,That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.,No
15186,Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.,No
15187,"He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.",Yes
15188,"If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.",No
15189,This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.,No
15190,It would be very disturbing to American people.,No
15191,"It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.",No
15192,"And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.",No
15193,"In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.",No
15194,"This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.",No
15196,"I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are.",No
15197,I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.,No
15198,"My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.",Yes
15199,"It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.",No
15200,"And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.",No
15201,"It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.",No
15202,And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.,No
15204,"I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.",No
15205,"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.",No
15206,She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms.,No
15207,This is a formidable force.,No
15208,Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.,Yes
15209,"If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.",Yes
15210,That's one major war explosion in a warhead.,No
15211,"We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.",Yes
15212,"The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",No
15218,"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.",No
15219,What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.,Yes
15220,"It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.",No
15221,We've been very successful in both cases.,No
15223,We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.,Yes
15224,"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",No
15225,We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.,No
15226,We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.,Yes
15227,We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.,Yes
15228,"And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.",Yes
15229,"This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.",No
15235,"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.",No
15236,"The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.",Yes
15237,The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.,Yes
15238,Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.,Yes
15239,"With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.",Yes
15240,"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.",No
15241,"The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.",Yes
15242,"Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.",Yes
15243,"It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.",Yes
15244,This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.,Yes
15245,Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.,Yes
15246,And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.,No
15247,"But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.",Yes
15248,We have the sources here.,No
15249,"We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.",Yes
15251,"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.",No
15252,"Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.",Yes
15253,We cannot cast aside these regulations.,No
15254,"We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.",No
15255,"Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.",Yes
15256,He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.,No
15258,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.",No
15260,The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.,Yes
15261,"It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.",Yes
15262,"And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.",No
15263,"As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.",Yes
15264,And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.,Yes
15265,"And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.",Yes
15266,"So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.",No
15267,"I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.",Yes
15268,"And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",No
15271,"As a matter of fact,.",No
15272,"the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.",Yes
15273,"Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.",No
15274,The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often.,No
15275,"As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.",Yes
15276,"We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.",Yes
15277,"So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.",No
15280,"If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.",Yes
15281,"It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.",Yes
15282,"We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.",Yes
15283,"As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.",Yes
15284,"The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.",No
15285,"There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.",Yes
15292,"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.",Yes
15293,"It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.",Yes
15294,"Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.",Yes
15295,"What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.",No
15296,"We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.",No
15297,"They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.",No
15298,"But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.",No
15304,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.",No
15305,"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.",Yes
15306,"I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.",Yes
15307,"These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.",No
15308,"But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.",No
15309,"And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.",Yes
15310,That is the way it will stay.,No
15312,"Well, that just isn't true.",No
15313,"It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.",Yes
15314,"Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.",No
15315,"Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.",Yes
15316,"And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.",Yes
15317,That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.,No
15318,"I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.",No
15319,There are some changes that I would like to make.,No
15320,"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.",No
15321,I'd like to change that.,No
15323,These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.,No
15324,"It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.",No
15325,"We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.",No
15326,"In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.",No
15327,"Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.",Yes
15328,"Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.",No
15329,"These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.",No
15330,"Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.",No
15332,"When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.",Yes
15333,I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.,No
15334,I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.,Yes
15335,I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.,Yes
15336,There is something else about Social Security.,No
15337,"Of course, it doesn't come out of the payroll tax.",Yes
15338,"It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it.",Yes
15339,"I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.",Yes
15341,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.",No
15342,"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.",No
15343,These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.,No
15344,I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.,No
15345,"I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.",No
15346,"So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.",No
15353,"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.",No
15354,"First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.",No
15355,"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.",No
15356,"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.",No
15357,"The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.",Yes
15358,"This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.",No
15359,"Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",No
15363,"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.",No
15364,I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.,No
15365,"It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.",No
15366,"Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.",Yes
15367,"He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.",Yes
15368,He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.,No
15369,"Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.",Yes
15370,"But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.",No
15371,I said many foolish things back in those days.,No
15372,"But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.",No
15373,"And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.",No
15374,"That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.",No
15375,It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.,No
15377,I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.,Yes
15378,I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.,No
15379,"For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.",Yes
15381,Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.,No
15382,"When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.",Yes
15383,And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.,Yes
15384,"That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",No
15387,"Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.",No
15388,"I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.",Yes
15389,"While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.",Yes
15390,"I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.",No
15391,"If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.",No
15392,"I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.",No
15394,"Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.",No
15395,One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.,Yes
15396,"We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.",No
15397,"We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.",Yes
15398,We're now working on the communications industry.,Yes
15399,"In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.",Yes
15400,We have made remarkable success.,No
15401,It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.,No
15402,"So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",No
15404,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.",No
15405,And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.,No
15406,"But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.",No
15407,"Those would all, could all be challenged by men.",No
15408,And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.,No
15410,"But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.",Yes
15413,"First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.",No
15414,I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.,No
15415,"Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.",No
15417,"I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.",No
15419,And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.,No
15420,"As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.",No
15421,I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.,No
15423,I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.,No
15424,The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.,No
15425,We must have a society that's just and fair.,No
15427,"I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.",Yes
15428,"In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.",No
15429,"I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.",No
15430,"But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.",No
15431,"And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.",No
15432,"It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.",No
15433,"The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.",No
15434,Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.,No
15435,And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.,No
15436,"If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.",Yes
15437,"And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.",No
15438,There is a partnership involved in our nation.,No
15439,"To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.",No
15440,I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.,No
15442,"Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.",No
15443,"I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.",No
15444,"But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.",No
15446,"Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.",No
15447,"I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?",No
15448,Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?,No
15449,Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?,No
15450,Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?,No
15451,"Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?",No
15452,"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.",No
15453,"If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.",No
15454,This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.,No
15455,"We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.",No
15456,We talk about the unemployment lines.,No
15457,"If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.",Yes
15458,All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.,No
15459,"I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.",Yes
15461,I know because we did it there.,No
15463,"We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.",Yes
15464,"We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.",Yes
15465,And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.,No
15466,"I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.",No
15467,"And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.",No
15483,And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.,Yes
15484,"I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.",No
15485,We've done so in my own state.,No
15486,And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.,Yes
15487,But we have work to do in this nation.,No
15488,"We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs.",No
15489,"And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.",No
15490,"We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.",No
15492,But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.,No
15493,And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.,No
15494,We've had great success in my own state.,No
15495,And we've reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades.,Yes
15496,"So we can fight this war, and we can win this war.",No
15497,"And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.",No
15499,"Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values.",No
15500,"And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.",No
15501,"You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.",No
15502,And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.,No
15503,And so we just have an honest difference of opinion: I support it and he doesn't.,Yes
15510,I'd have confidence in him.,No
15511,And I made a good selection.,No
15512,"And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.",No
15513,And I've never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before.,No
15515,"But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.",No
15516,He had two terms in the Congress.,No
15517,"He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.",Yes
15518,"He founded authored, the job training partnership act.",Yes
15519,It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they're going to have jobs.,Yes
15520,"We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.",No
15521,"He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.",Yes
15522,"If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.",No
15523,And so I have great confidence in him.,No
15526,They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.,No
15528,And so I'm proud of my choice.,No
15529,"And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.",No
15530,"But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.",No
15531,I made a good selection.,No
15532,"The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.",No
15533,And he could do the job.,No
15536,"Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.",No
15537,And that's why people are so concerned.,No
15538,Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.,No
15539,"More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.",Yes
15540,The Vice President talks about national security.,No
15541,"Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief.",Yes
15542,"I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job.",No
15544,"Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did.",No
15553,"No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up.",No
15554,"And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.",Yes
15555,And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.,No
15556,I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.,No
15557,"More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.",Yes
15558,And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.,No
15560,And what I have proposed is something much better.,No
15562,And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.,No
15563,I hear this talk about a blank check.,No
15566,It is the United States Congress.,No
15567,"And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.",No
15568,And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes.,No
15569,So I'm pledged to do that.,No
15573,"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.",No
15574,He's broken it three times in the past year already.,Yes
15575,So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.,No
15576,"And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around.",No
15577,"He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly.",Yes
15579,And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.,Yes
15580,"Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.",Yes
15581,"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",No
15588,"No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.",No
15589,There is no way of anticipating what may happen.,No
15590,"I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.",No
15591,And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.,No
15592,Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.,Yes
15593,That's not what we are going to do.,No
15594,I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.,No
15595,"But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.",Yes
15596,"Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.",No
15598,"Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.",No
15599,But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.,No
15600,"And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.",No
15603,He has raised taxes several times.,Yes
15604,"I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.",No
15605,"(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.",No
15606,And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.,Yes
15608,(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.,No
15609,I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along.,Yes
15610,"And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.",No
15611,(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.,No
15621,I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.,No
15625,"Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.",Yes
15627,"(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.",No
15628,I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.,No
15629,I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.,No
15630,"(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.",No
15631,But I'm also a serious guy.,No
15634,(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.,No
15635,"Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes.",Yes
15636,"I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.",Yes
15637,"And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.",Yes
15639,"The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.",No
15642,"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",No
15644,I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.,No
15647,You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.,No
15649,"And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.",No
15657,What was he referring to?,No
15659,"I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.",No
15660,"And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.",No
15661,"And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.",No
15662,"And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.",No
15663,And in the process the negatives began.,No
15664,It wasn't me that was there at that convention.,No
15665,Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.,No
15666,And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.,No
15668,"But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.",No
15669,"He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.",No
15670,And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.,No
15671,Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.,No
15673,"But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.",No
15676,"Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels.",No
15677,"I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left.",No
15678,"In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control.",Yes
15679,And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.,Yes
15680,They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.,No
15683,And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.,No
15684,"The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.",No
15687,We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.,No
15688,And that's the kind of America I want.,No
15691,There's nothing the matter with that.,No
15692,But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.,No
15702,"If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.",No
15703,"They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?",No
15704,"I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.",Yes
15705,"I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.",No
15706,"It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.",No
15708,"I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.",No
15709,"So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.",No
15712,We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.,Yes
15713,And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.,No
15714,My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.,No
15715,But we are protecting both of them.,No
15716,"We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.",No
15720,"We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain.",Yes
15721,"And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.",No
15723,"Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.",No
15724,"I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.",Yes
15725,Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.,No
15727,We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars.,No
15728,"We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.",Yes
15729,We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.,No
15732,We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.,No
15733,But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.,No
15734,"I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.",No
15742,"Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.",Yes
15743,That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.,No
15744,"I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad.",No
15745,But there are limits to what we can spend.,No
15746,There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.,No
15747,And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.,No
15748,How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?,No
15749,"And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.",No
15752,"We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.",No
15753,"And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.",No
15754,"And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.",No
15755,And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.,No
15756,That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.,No
15757,I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.,No
15758,But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.,No
15759,"We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.",No
15760,And that's the kind of America I want to build.,No
15762,I think the foremost (Applause),No
15764,I held off for the applause.,No
15766,I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.,No
15767,"The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.",No
15768,"It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.",No
15769,He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons.,No
15770,"And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.",No
15772,"And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.",Yes
15773,And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.,Yes
15774,You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.,No
15775,"World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace.",Yes
15776,And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.,No
15784,"Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.",No
15785,But there are many people who I admire in this country today.,No
15786,"Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.",No
15788,I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.,No
15790,"We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us.",No
15791,"I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.",No
15793,"I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.",No
15797,Members of the clergy who have done the same.,No
15798,"Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.",No
15799,"I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.",No
15800,"So there are many, many heroes in this country today.",No
15802,"In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.",No
15803,"And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.",No
15805,"I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college.",Yes
15806,"I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail.",No
15807,"Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.",No
15808,"I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.",No
15809,I agree with the Governor on athletics.,No
15811,I think of Dr. Fauci.,No
15812,Probably never heard of him.,No
15813,"You did, Ann heard of him.",No
15814,"He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.",No
15815,"But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.",No
15816,He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.,Yes
15819,"And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people",Yes
15821,"say, he is our hero.",No
15831,"No, let me tell you something about that.",No
15832,And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.,No
15833,"And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.",No
15834,"And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.",No
15835,"You all know me, and we've held it back a little.",No
15836,"But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.",No
15837,And we've got a strong family.,No
15839,"And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.",No
15840,And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.,No
15841,"You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.",No
15843,"And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.",No
15844,I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.,No
15845,Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.,No
15846,It's gotten a little nasty.,No
15847,It's not much fun sometimes.,No
15848,And I would cite again Dan Quayle.,No
15849,"I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.",No
15851,So some of it is unfair.,No
15852,But he's in the arena.,No
15853,"Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.",No
15855,So I salute these things.,No
15857,Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.,No
15858,He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.,No
15859,"Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.",No
15860,"Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.",No
15862,"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time.",No
15863,I thank you for that.,No
15866,"And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.",No
15867,They can't live in the community which they grew up in.,No
15868,Those are basic American values.,No
15870,I think you believe in them.,No
15871,They're not left or right.,No
15873,"I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.",No
15875,We may think that you deal with them in different ways.,No
15876,"But they're basically American, I believe in them.",No
15877,George Bush believes in them.,No
15878,I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.,No
15882,I think the American people would appreciate that.,No
15888,"Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother.",No
15889,Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.,No
15890,"Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.",No
15891,"I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.",No
15892,"And I said, what can we do about it.",No
15893,"He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.",No
15894,We took the child to New York.,No
15895,"Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.",No
15896,"If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.",No
15897,And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.,No
15898,"I think human life is very, very precious.",No
15899,"And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet.",No
15900,I know others disagree with it.,No
15901,"But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.",No
15902,And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from.,No
15904,"And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.",No
15908,"Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.",No
15909,"But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions.",No
15910,"It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?",No
15911,"(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",No
15912,"Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?",No
15913,"That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.",No
15914,"And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.",No
15919,"And, incidentally, may I say that that's the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.",No
15922,"I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.",No
15923,"No, I don't happen to share that goal.",No
15924,"It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.",No
15925,"But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.",No
15926,And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.,No
15927,"But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.",Yes
15928,"And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.",No
15929,So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.,No
15931,But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.,No
15934,"And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.",No
15935,This is a big question.,No
15936,And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.,No
15940,"So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.",No
15941,I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.,No
15942,"But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.",No
15943,And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.,No
15944,The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.,No
15945,"And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided",No
15953,"And some domestic programs as well, Andrea.",No
15958,May I disagree with the premise of your question?,No
15961,"As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans.",Yes
15962,We don't have an alternative.,No
15963,We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.,No
15964,But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.,Yes
15965,And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.,No
15966,"The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat.",No
15967,"It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.",Yes
15968,"The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.",No
15969,"In my own state, we did it.",Yes
15970,"In other states, we've done it.",Yes
15971,Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.,No
15972,And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.,No
15973,"Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again.",No
15974,"Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.",Yes
15975,"But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.",No
15976,"But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that",Yes
15978,and that's where you begin.,No
15980,"Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept.",No
15981,"And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic.",No
15982,They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States.,No
15983,I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.,No
15984,"I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.",No
15985,And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending.,No
15986,And we are doing a better job of it.,No
15990,The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.,No
15991,The Federal Government continues to spend too much.,No
15997,More so you than me.,No
15999,"No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created.",No
16000,It wasn't created as a welfare program.,Yes
16001,It wasn't created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program.,Yes
16002,It wasn't created as a welfare program.,Yes
16004,"We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.",Yes
16005,"So, I don't want to fool around with it.",No
16007,It always works that way.,No
16009,In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.,No
16010,We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.,No
16011,And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.,No
16013,And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.,No
16016,"And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.",No
16018,Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.,No
16020,"Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.",No
16021,"George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.",Yes
16023,"And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA.",No
16024,I voted against that at the National Governors Association.,Yes
16025,"We won a majority, we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George.",Yes
16026,But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.,No
16027,"The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.",No
16028,You did it in 1985.,Yes
16029,"The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82.",No
16030,And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.,No
16031,Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.,No
16032,"There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund.",No
16037,One I don't have a list yet.,No
16038,"I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.",No
16040,"Secondly, I don't have any litmus test.",No
16041,"But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.",No
16042,I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.,No
16043,"They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat.""",Yes
16045,There is no litmus test on any issue.,No
16052,If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause),No
16053,that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.,No
16055,And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.,No
16056,"You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge.",Yes
16057,"I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.",Yes
16059,And I'm very proud of it.,No
16060,I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.,No
16061,"I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.",No
16062,I don't appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative.,No
16063,"I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.",No
16064,And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.,No
16065,These appointments are for life.,No
16066,These appointments are for life.,No
16067,"And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who he's talking about?",No
16068,"Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.",No
16074,"Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?",No
16076,And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.,Yes
16077,"Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.",Yes
16078,"Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.",No
16079,It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support.,Yes
16080,But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country.,No
16081,"So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means.",No
16082,Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.,No
16083,"I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.",Yes
16085,That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.,No
16087,I think I've addressed it.,No
16088,"But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.",Yes
16089,And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.,No
16090,"And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.",No
16091,So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.,No
16092,"And I've said that I'm going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound.",No
16094,And I have made some good sound proposals.,No
16095,"But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example.",No
16096,"You see, I want the families to have the choice.",No
16097,I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.,No
16098,"I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.",No
16100,"I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light.",No
16102,And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.,No
16109,That is absolutely not true.,No
16111,That is absolutely not true.,No
16112,It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.,No
16113,It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.,No
16115,"No, and I have to (Applause)",No
16118,"Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association.",No
16120,"If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass.",Yes
16121,"But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.",No
16122,And I never made that statement; never would.,Yes
16123,"The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.",No
16124,I want to move ahead.,No
16125,The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.,No
16126,I'm interested in 240 million points of light.,No
16127,"I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.",No
16129,The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program.,Yes
16132,"It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.",No
16133,"It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.",No
16134,So that's not where we ought to go.,No
16135,There are plenty of places to cut.,No
16136,There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.,No
16137,There are we certainly ought to be able to,No
16139,"Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.",No
16140,"That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.",No
16142,"Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.",No
16143,"We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.",No
16144,He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.,No
16146,"He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states.",No
16148,"I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.",No
16149,"And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.",No
16150,"In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers?",Yes
16151,We never should go back to that.,No
16152,And we ought to expand our markets abroad.,No
16153,We ought to have rural enterprise zones.,No
16155,But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.,Yes
16157,The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.,Yes
16167,90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.,Yes
16168,"It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?",No
16173,But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.,No
16174,"We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.",No
16175,"But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.",No
16176,I am for clean water.,No
16177,I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.,No
16178,I've been to these national parks.,No
16179,I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson.,Yes
16180,"I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.",No
16182,And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending.,No
16183,That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.,No
16185,I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.,No
16188,"Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?",No
16189,"Come on, give me five.",No
16190,"I mean, this guy, this is too much.",No
16191,But I'm not going to do that.,No
16194,I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.,No
16195,"And I'll do a good job, because I am committed.",No
16198,"Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.",No
16199,"George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.",No
16201,"Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?",No
16202,I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.,No
16203,"I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.",Yes
16204,"That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America.",Yes
16205,"Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about here or looking at.",No
16206,"The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.",No
16207,"But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.",Yes
16208,"George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.",Yes
16209,I'm the first governor to clean it up.,Yes
16212,We've been cleaning it up for four years.,Yes
16213,We passed landmark legislation in '84.,No
16215,You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act,Yes
16217,And those grants which make it possible for states and local communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams.,No
16228,The American people are up to here with debates.,No
16229,They had thirty of them; we had seven of them.,Yes
16230,Now we've got three of them.,No
16231,"I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we don't need any more debates.",No
16232,I've spelled out my position.,No
16234,But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.,No
16235,"Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.",No
16237,"If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.",No
16238,"We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.",No
16239,"And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.",No
16241,"Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.",No
16242,And so I don't know what the answer is.,No
16243,Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.,No
16244,"How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow.",No
16245,"So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.",No
16247,There will be no more debates.,No
16250,"I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.",No
16251,"(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.",No
16252,"Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.",No
16253,"Yes, we have fundamental differences.",No
16254,I think a great many of them have come out today.,No
16255,"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away.",No
16259,"I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.",No
16260,I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors.,Yes
16261,I am concerned about what that does to our future.,No
16262,I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.,Yes
16268,"I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.",No
16270,"And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.",No
16271,"That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.",No
16272,"But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions.",No
16273,"I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.",No
16277,The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us.,No
16278,"I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.",No
16279,"We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.",No
16280,But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America.,Yes
16282,Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.,No
16284,"In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.",No
16285,And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.,No
16286,"My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola.",No
16287,"It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.",No
16288,We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.,No
16289,"That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.",No
16290,"And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom.",Yes
16291,"Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.",No
16296,"Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.",No
16297,This is another example of misplaced priorities.,No
16298,"An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.",No
16299,"Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons.",No
16302,Who's been managing this system?,No
16303,Why have there been these safety violations?,No
16304,Why are these plants being closed down?,No
16305,"I don't know what the latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion.",No
16306,"Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.",No
16309,"And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.",No
16311,"That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.",No
16312,Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?,No
16317,"I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.",No
16318,"And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.",Yes
16319,"But we're going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base.",No
16322,and must do what he's talking about now.,No
16328,"Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.",No
16331,"Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.",No
16333,And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.,No
16334,His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.,Yes
16336,"And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.",No
16337,He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese.,No
16338,"Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards.",No
16339,I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.,No
16341,"I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.",No
16342,"But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.",No
16343,"And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.",No
16344,"But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record.",No
16345,"And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.",Yes
16346,And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.,No
16347,His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.,No
16348,So let's not be throwing stones about it.,No
16349,"Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.",No
16350,Let's vow to work together to do something about it.,No
16352,And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.,No
16353,"But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.",No
16354,Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?,No
16355,Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior?,No
16356,"Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States.",No
16357,"We've had dozens we've had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted.",No
16358,This isn't the kind of Administration we need.,No
16359,"And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for.",No
16361,Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.,No
16362,I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.,No
16368,"28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.",No
16369,I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.,No
16371,That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.,No
16372,26 days from today you and millions of Americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the United States.,No
16373,"Our opponents say, things are okay.",No
16376,They say we should be satisfied.,No
16377,"But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.",Yes
16378,We can do better than that.,No
16379,"Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.",No
16380,"Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.",No
16381,"And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.",No
16382,Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given to us in your homes and communities all across this country.,No
16383,"We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.",No
16384,And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.,No
16385,"Thank you, and God bless you.",No
16389,"So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.",No
16390,But we have enormous differences.,No
16391,"I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits.",No
16393,Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.,No
16394,"And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.",No
16395,"I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals.",No
16396,That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.,No
16397,I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.,No
16398,There is much to be done.,No
16399,This election is about big things.,No
16400,And perhaps the biggest is world peace.,No
16401,And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.,No
16403,And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement.,No
16404,I want to build on that.,No
16405,"I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.",No
16406,Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth.,No
16407,"And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.",No
16409,And I will be a good president.,No
16411,"Thank you very, very much.",No
16438,First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.,No
16439,"This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.",No
16440,"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.",No
16441,There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.,No
16442,"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.",No
16443,"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.",No
16444,"Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.",Yes
16445,"Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.",Yes
16446,Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.,No
16447,"Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.",No
16448,"These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.",No
16449,"There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.",No
16450,In a > Transfer interrupted!,No
16451,"ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.",No
16452,"But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",Yes
16454,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?",No
16455,Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.,Yes
16456,"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.",No
16457,I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.,No
16458,But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.,No
16460,I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.,No
16461,I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.,Yes
16462,"That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.",Yes
16463,"It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.",Yes
16464,We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.,Yes
16465,"We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.",No
16466,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.,No
16473,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.",Yes
16474,"I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.",Yes
16475,"And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.",Yes
16476,"In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.",Yes
16477,"That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.",Yes
16478,"But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.",No
16479,"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.",Yes
16480,For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.,Yes
16481,We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.,No
16482,And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.,Yes
16483,"With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.",Yes
16484,"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",No
16488,That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.,Yes
16489,"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",No
16490,"And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.",Yes
16491,"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.",Yes
16492,So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.,No
16493,"Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.",Yes
16494,It has some good provisions in it.,No
16495,"It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.",No
16496,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.",No
16497,"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.",No
16499,"Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.",Yes
16500,The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.,No
16501,"As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.",Yes
16503,"In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.",Yes
16504,"In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.",Yes
16505,"The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.",No
16506,"As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.",Yes
16507,"We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.",Yes
16508,And this is what the Republicans have done to us.,No
16515,"Well, as a matter of fact there is.",No
16516,"If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.",Yes
16517,Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.,No
16518,"I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.",No
16519,I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.,No
16520,And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.,No
16522,"And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.",No
16526,"Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.",No
16529,And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.,No
16530,"Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.",No
16531,Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.,No
16532,The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.,No
16533,"And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.",No
16534,"And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.",Yes
16535,"But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.",No
16536,Keep my promises to the American people.,No
16537,"And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",No
16539,"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.",No
16540,I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.,No
16541,It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.,No
16542,"But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.",Yes
16543,"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.",Yes
16544,"And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.",Yes
16545,"Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.",Yes
16546,I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.,No
16547,"We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.",Yes
16553,The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.,Yes
16554,About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.,Yes
16555,We gave them ample time.,No
16556,I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.,No
16557,"Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.",No
16558,"There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.",No
16559,"Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.",No
16560,"It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.",No
16563,The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.,Yes
16564,"So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",No
16567,"Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.",Yes
16568,I do not agree with that point of view.,No
16569,"I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.",Yes
16570,I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.,No
16572,Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.,No
16573,As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.,No
16574,There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.,No
16575,Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.,No
16576,"Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.",No
16577,And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.,No
16578,I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.,Yes
16580,"We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.",No
16581,"And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.",No
16582,But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.,No
16587,"Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.",No
16588,"When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.",Yes
16589,And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.,Yes
16590,We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.,Yes
16591,We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.,No
16592,It hasn't been undone since I was there.,No
16593,"It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.",Yes
16594,I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.,No
16595,"When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.",No
16596,We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.,No
16597,"When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.",Yes
16598,"That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.",Yes
16599,This needs to be changed.,No
16601,We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.,No
16602,"For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.",Yes
16603,Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.,No
16604,The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.,No
16605,None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.,No
16606,This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.,No
16607,We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.,Yes
16608,Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.,Yes
16609,"We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.",Yes
16610,"This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.",No
16613,I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.,No
16614,It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.,Yes
16616,"Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.",Yes
16617,But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.,Yes
16618,"For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.",No
16619,We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.,Yes
16620,And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.,Yes
16621,The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.,No
16622,I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.,Yes
16623,"For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.",Yes
16624,"In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.",Yes
16625,"But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.",No
16627,"If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.",No
16628,There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.,No
16629,There's no way to get the answer to a question.,No
16630,"When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.",Yes
16632,This is the kind of change that would be made.,No
16633,"And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",No
16635,"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.",Yes
16636,"And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.",No
16637,"He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.",Yes
16638,Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.,Yes
16639,And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.,Yes
16640,"In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.",Yes
16641,"We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.",Yes
16642,"So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.",No
16650,"Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.",No
16651,"We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.",Yes
16652,"But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.",Yes
16653,The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.,No
16654,And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.,No
16655,We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.,No
16656,"We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.",No
16657,We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.,Yes
16658,But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.,Yes
16659,"We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.",No
16660,"We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.",Yes
16661,That doesn't cost any more money.,No
16662,We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.,No
16663,We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.,No
16664,It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.,Yes
16665,At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.,Yes
16666,I don't know where that money would come from.,No
16667,"But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",No
16669,"We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.",No
16670,"We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.",No
16671,"As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.",Yes
16672,We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.,No
16673,"Employment will be up, revenues will be up.",No
16675,"Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.",No
16676,"He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.",Yes
16677,We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.,Yes
16678,Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.,No
16679,"We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.",No
16681,"Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.",No
16682,"In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.",Yes
16683,Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.,Yes
16684,"I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.",Yes
16685,The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.,No
16686,Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,Yes
16687,"We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.",Yes
16688,We've also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon.,No
16689,He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.,Yes
16690,"This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.",Yes
16691,"We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.",Yes
16693,This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.,No
16700,I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.,No
16701,But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.,Yes
16702,I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.,Yes
16703,"We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.",No
16704,"Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.",Yes
16705,I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.,Yes
16706,We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.,No
16707,The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.,Yes
16708,"In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.",Yes
16709,We're gonna run out of oil.,No
16710,When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.,Yes
16711,Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.,Yes
16712,We now import about 44 percent of our oil.,Yes
16713,We need to shift from oil to coal.,No
16714,"We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.",No
16715,We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.,No
16716,"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.",No
16717,I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.,No
16718,We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.,No
16719,"But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.",No
16720,"For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.",No
16721,There ought to be a standardized design.,No
16722,"There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.",No
16723,"These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.",No
16724,"So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.",No
16725,That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.,No
16728,Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.,No
16729,"We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.",Yes
16730,We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.,No
16731,"We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.",No
16732,"And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.",Yes
16733,"In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.",No
16734,"A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.",Yes
16735,Uh - this would - would help a great deal.,No
16736,So mandatory conservation measures - yes.,No
16737,Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.,No
16738,And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.,No
16739,"One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.",Yes
16740,"And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.",Yes
16741,"These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.",No
16743,Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.,No
16744,In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.,No
16745,It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.,Yes
16746,It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.,No
16747,If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.,No
16748,I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.,Yes
16749,"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.",No
16750,In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.,No
16751,"In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.",Yes
16752,We're going as fast as the experts say we should.,Yes
16753,"In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.",Yes
16754,"I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.",No
16760,"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.",Yes
16761,Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.,Yes
16762,Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.,Yes
16763,Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.,No
16764,"In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.",Yes
16765,They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.,No
16766,The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.,No
16767,What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.,Yes
16768,"And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.",No
16769,"For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.",Yes
16770,"We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.",Yes
16771,We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.,Yes
16772,Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.,No
16773,"And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.",No
16774,"I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.",No
16775,"It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.",Yes
16778,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.",Yes
16779,"But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.",Yes
16780,"These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.",No
16781,I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.,Yes
16783,"As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.",Yes
16784,"And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.",Yes
16785,Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.,No
16786,And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.,Yes
16787,Now he can't have it both ways.,No
16788,"And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.",No
16790,"Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.",Yes
16791,"I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.",No
16792,"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?""",No
16793,About a thousand raised their hands.,Yes
16794,Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.,Yes
16795,And still he talks about - uh success.,No
16796,Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.,Yes
16797,He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.,No
16799,"We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.",Yes
16800,"And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.",Yes
16801,"This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.",No
16802,He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.,Yes
16803,There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.,Yes
16804,"And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.",Yes
16805,"This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.",Yes
16807,It shows a lack of leadership.,No
16808,And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.,Yes
16809,Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.,Yes
16810,And eleven of 'em have been overridden.,Yes
16811,"One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.",Yes
16821,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.",Yes
16822,"Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.",Yes
16823,"Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.",Yes
16824,That's got to be changed.,No
16825,A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.,Yes
16826,"When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.",No
16827,"Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.",No
16829,"This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.",Yes
16830,This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.,Yes
16831,"And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.",No
16832,"Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.",No
16833,"The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.",No
16834,"Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.",Yes
16835,"Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.",No
16836,They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.,Yes
16837,"Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.",Yes
16838,The average uh American person can't do it.,No
16839,You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.,No
16843,"You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.",Yes
16844,Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.,Yes
16845,"DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.",Yes
16846,"uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.",Yes
16848,"No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.",No
16849,I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.,No
16850,"But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.",No
16852,"What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.",No
16854,"These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.",Yes
16855,It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.,No
16858,In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.,Yes
16859,"Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.",Yes
16860,I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.,No
16861,"They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.",Yes
16862,"I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.",No
16863,Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.,No
16864,"Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.",No
16865,The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.,Yes
16866,"President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.",Yes
16867,"I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.",Yes
16868,My average in two years is twenty-six.,Yes
16869,But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.,Yes
16870,"And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.",No
16871,I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.,Yes
16881,There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.,No
16883,"In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.",No
16884,"The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.",No
16885,"For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.",No
16886,It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.,No
16887,I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.,No
16888,"We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.",Yes
16889,"Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.",No
16890,And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.,No
16891,"So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.",No
16892,They spend too much money on themselves.,No
16893,They have too many employees.,No
16894,There's some question about their morality.,No
16895,"It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.",No
16901,"Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.",No
16902,We will make some gains in the United States Senate.,No
16903,"So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.",No
16904,"But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.",No
16905,Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.,No
16906,"He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.",No
16907,I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.,No
16908,"We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.",No
16910,"I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",No
16912,"Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.",No
16913,It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.,No
16914,President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.,No
16915,"Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.",Yes
16916,"Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.",Yes
16917,"Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.",Yes
16918,I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.,Yes
16919,This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.,No
16920,"This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.",No
16921,We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.,No
16922,"And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.",No
16923,"That, I think, is a good balance.",No
16924,"But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.",No
16925,"Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.",Yes
16926,"And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.",No
16928,Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.,No
16929,"That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.",No
16939,"What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.",No
16940,The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.,Yes
16941,The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.,No
16942,"The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.",Yes
16943,"They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.",Yes
16944,I would have uh - done it opposite.,No
16945,"I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.",No
16946,But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.,No
16947,I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.,No
16948,"But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.",No
16950,The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.,No
16951,"Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.",No
16952,As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.,No
16953,Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.,Yes
16954,They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.,No
16955,It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.,No
16956,It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.,No
16963,"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.",Yes
16964,We've done that by executive order.,Yes
16965,Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.,No
16966,It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.,No
16967,"Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.",No
16968,"This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.",Yes
16969,"But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.",No
16970,"So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.",No
16971,And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.,No
16972,"We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.",No
16974,"Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]",No
16984,There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.,No
16987,"Well, tonight we've had a chance to talk a lot about the past.",No
16989,Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.,No
16990,It's a time for unity.,No
16992,"It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.",No
16993,And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.,No
16994,"For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.",No
16995,This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.,No
16997,It needs to be competent.,No
16998,"The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.",No
16999,We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.,No
17001,We've got a government of stalemate.,No
17002,We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.,No
17003,This is not the America that we've known in the past.,No
17004,It's not the America that we have to have in the future.,No
17005,I don't claim to know all the answers.,No
17006,But I've got confidence in my country.,No
17007,Our economic strength is still there.,No
17008,"Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.",No
17009,"And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.",No
17010,We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.,No
17011,I owe the special interests nothing.,No
17013,And I believe that we can bind our wounds.,No
17014,I believe that we can work together.,No
17015,"And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.",No
17017,"On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.",No
17018,One of the major issues in this campaign is trust.,No
17019,A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.,No
17020,A president can't be all things to all people.,No
17021,A president should be the same thing to all people.,No
17022,"Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes.",No
17023,"Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.",Yes
17024,It calls for more of the same.,No
17025,"Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.",No
17026,"I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.",No
17027,On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.,No
17028,It was a superb occasion.,No
17029,It was a glorious day.,No
17030,In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.,No
17031,"In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.",No
17032,Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.,No
17033,In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.,No
17035,We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.,No
17036,The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.,No
17037,The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.,No
17038,"My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.",No
17039,Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.,No
17040,"Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.",No
17041,You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.,No
17042,I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.,No
17087,I have a plan -- not a secret plan.,No
17088,"As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.",Yes
17089,"It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.",Yes
17090,"Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.",Yes
17091,"So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.",No
17092,"Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.",Yes
17093,"Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.",Yes
17094,"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.",No
17095,We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.,Yes
17096,"The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.",Yes
17097,"In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.",Yes
17098,"So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.",Yes
17099,"And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.",No
17105,The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.,Yes
17106,"I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.",No
17107,But it has taken place.,Yes
17108,"But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.",Yes
17109,If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.,Yes
17112,"Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.",Yes
17117,One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.,No
17118,And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.,No
17119,"I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.",No
17120,"But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.",Yes
17122,We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.,Yes
17123,It was $200 billion deficit instead.,Yes
17124,And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.,No
17125,"Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.",Yes
17126,"In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.",No
17127,It gets larger even with growth.,No
17128,What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.,No
17129,This is the worst trade year in American history by far.,Yes
17130,Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.,No
17131,"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.",No
17132,I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.,Yes
17133,"I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.",No
17139,"These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.",No
17140,The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.,No
17141,"Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.",Yes
17142,And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.,No
17143,"And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.",Yes
17148,I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.,No
17149,"And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.",Yes
17150,"And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.",Yes
17151,"So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.",Yes
17152,"Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.",No
17153,"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''",No
17154,"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''",No
17155,I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.,No
17157,"Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.",Yes
17158,"And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.",Yes
17161,"I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.",No
17171,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.",No
17172,"There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.",No
17173,And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.,No
17174,The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.,Yes
17175,No one else believes that's the case.,No
17176,"I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.",No
17177,I think that's what leadership is all about.,No
17178,"There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.",No
17179,"What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.",No
17180,"Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.",Yes
17181,"The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.",Yes
17182,"There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.",Yes
17183,"Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.",No
17184,"It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.",No
17185,"I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.",No
17186,And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.,No
17187,I am answering your questions.,No
17188,"I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",No
17191,"Well, I think we're getting better all the time.",No
17192,"And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.",No
17193,"And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.",No
17194,"He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",No
17198,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.",No
17199,"And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.",Yes
17201,"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.",No
17202,"In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.",No
17203,"Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.",No
17204,I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.,No
17205,"And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.",No
17206,"You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.",No
17207,But I also believe something else about that.,No
17208,"I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.",No
17209,I don't want to hear them.,No
17210,I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?,No
17211,"And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.",No
17212,"Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",Yes
17216,Our policy was not to cut subsidies.,No
17217,"We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.",No
17218,"And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.",No
17220,"We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.",No
17221,"We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.",No
17222,"The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",Yes
17224,"Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.",No
17225,"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''",No
17226,[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.,Yes
17227,It's not an opinion; it's a fact.,No
17228,"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?",No
17229,"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''",Yes
17230,That's Social Security and Medicare.,No
17231,The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.,Yes
17232,"So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.",No
17233,"This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.",No
17234,We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.,No
17236,"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.",No
17237,"When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.",No
17238,Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.,Yes
17239,"Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.",Yes
17240,"And so, we made a proposal.",No
17241,"And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.",No
17242,"And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.",Yes
17243,"Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.",Yes
17244,"And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.",Yes
17245,"And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",Yes
17249,"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.",No
17250,"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.",No
17251,"But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.",No
17252,"And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.",No
17253,And I do resort to prayer.,No
17254,"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.",No
17255,"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.",No
17256,"So, it does play a part in my life.",No
17257,I have no hesitancy in saying so.,No
17258,"And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",No
17260,The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.,No
17261,"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.",No
17262,"And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.",No
17263,I know the threats that are made against me.,No
17265,We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.,No
17266,"And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.",No
17267,"And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.",No
17272,"First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.",No
17273,"I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.",No
17275,My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.,No
17276,"And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.",No
17277,And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.,No
17278,"Whether that helps or not, I don't know.",No
17279,I have a deep religious faith.,No
17282,It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.,No
17284,And I think we're all together on that.,No
17285,"What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.",No
17286,All history tells us that that's a mistake.,No
17288,This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.,Yes
17289,That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.,No
17290,"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",No
17303,What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.,No
17304,"A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.",No
17305,"The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.",No
17306,It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.,No
17309,"Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.",No
17310,"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.",No
17311,"The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.",No
17312,"And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.",Yes
17313,A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.,No
17314,"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.",No
17315,"With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.",No
17316,I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.,No
17317,I'll stand on my record on that.,No
17318,"And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",No
17320,"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.",No
17321,And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.,No
17322,And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.,Yes
17323,Let's take the example that the President cites.,No
17326,We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.,No
17327,But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?,No
17328,Who would write the prayer?,No
17330,How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?,No
17347,My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.,No
17348,"And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.",No
17349,The American people want arms control.,No
17350,They don't want this arms race.,No
17351,And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.,No
17352,And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.,No
17353,"The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.",No
17354,"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.",No
17355,"They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.",Yes
17356,"And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.",No
17357,The American people want this environment protected.,No
17358,"They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.",Yes
17359,The American people want their children educated.,No
17360,"They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.",No
17362,They want those civil rights laws enforced.,No
17363,They want the equal rights amendment ratified.,No
17364,They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.,No
17365,"And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.",No
17366,"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",No
17368,"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.",No
17369,The President says it'll disappear automatically.,No
17370,I've said it's going to take some work.,No
17371,I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.,No
17372,"Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.",Yes
17373,"The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.",Yes
17374,"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",No
17377,"Well, again, I'm running on the record.",No
17378,I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.,No
17379,But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.,No
17380,"We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.",Yes
17381,"And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.",No
17382,"And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.",Yes
17383,"I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.",Yes
17384,"We have, to one-third of what it was.",Yes
17385,I promised that we would reduce taxes.,No
17386,"We did, 25 percent across the board.",Yes
17387,That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.,Yes
17388,But at least it took that burden away from them.,No
17390,"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.",No
17393,And I think this is something the American people see.,No
17394,I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.,Yes
17395,"And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.",Yes
17396,We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.,Yes
17397,All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.,Yes
17398,"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.",No
17401,"There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.",No
17402,"Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.",Yes
17403,"I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.",No
17405,"Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.",No
17406,"When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.",Yes
17407,And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.,No
17408,"We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.",Yes
17409,"I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.",No
17413,"The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.",Yes
17414,The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.,Yes
17415,"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''",No
17416,"Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.",No
17417,"And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.",No
17418,The President just said that his government is shrinking.,No
17421,"And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.",No
17422,That's where government should not be.,No
17424,"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.",No
17425,"And so, my change had come earlier than that.",No
17426,I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.,No
17427,I found that was rather difficult to do.,No
17428,But I finally did it.,No
17429,"There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.",No
17430,Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.,No
17431,The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.,Yes
17432,"The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.",Yes
17433,"All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.",No
17445,I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.,No
17446,"Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.",No
17447,"But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.",No
17448,"With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.",No
17449,"I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.",No
17450,"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.",No
17451,"And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.",Yes
17452,"We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.",No
17453,"Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.",No
17454,"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",Yes
17455,"Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?",No
17456,"And it used the term ""death of the unborn child.''",Yes
17457,"So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",No
17463,The laws regarding that always were State laws.,Yes
17464,It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.,Yes
17465,Our laws against murder are State laws.,Yes
17466,"So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.",No
17467,"As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.",No
17468,And no one has approached it from that matter.,No
17469,It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.,No
17470,I know that some churches do.,No
17471,"Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.",No
17472,"At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.",Yes
17473,"And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",No
17477,"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.",No
17478,The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.,Yes
17479,"Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?",No
17480,"I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.",No
17481,Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.,No
17482,The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.,No
17483,"I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.",No
17484,Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.,No
17486,"Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.",No
17487,Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.,No
17488,That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.,No
17489,But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?,No
17490,Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?,No
17491,"I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.",No
17492,"In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.",No
17493,We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.,No
17494,It's been a good instinct.,No
17495,And we're the most religious people on Earth.,Yes
17496,"One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.",Yes
17502,"The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.",No
17503,"And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.",No
17504,I don't know the answer to when life begins.,No
17505,"And it's not that simple, either.",No
17507,"And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",No
17508,"If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",No
17518,"Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?",No
17519,"Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.",No
17520,I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.,No
17521,I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.,No
17522,"That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.",No
17524,There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.,Yes
17526,"I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.",Yes
17528,But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.,No
17529,And I don't agree with it.,No
17530,"Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.",No
17531,The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.,No
17532,"Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.",Yes
17533,"And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.",Yes
17534,It's been a big failure.,No
17535,I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.,Yes
17536,I'm opposed to these policies as well.,No
17551,"Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.",Yes
17552,"That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.",No
17553,What does this mean in real life?,No
17554,"Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.",Yes
17555,"He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.",Yes
17556,In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.,Yes
17557,"In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.",Yes
17558,That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.,Yes
17559,I believe we need some fairness.,No
17560,And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.,No
17564,"The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.",Yes
17565,"Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.",No
17566,And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.,No
17568,They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.,Yes
17569,"Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.",Yes
17570,"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.",No
17571,I don't think we can do that for a few years.,No
17572,"But at some point, we want to do that as well.",No
17575,"You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.",No
17577,[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.,No
17579,"I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.",Yes
17580,"Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.",No
17581,And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.,Yes
17582,"And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.",Yes
17583,"From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.",Yes
17584,"Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.",No
17586,It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.,Yes
17587,"At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.",Yes
17588,"Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.",Yes
17589,"And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.",Yes
17590,"Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.",No
17591,"The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.",No
17592,"But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.",Yes
17593,"Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.",Yes
17594,"But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",No
17598,"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me.",No
17599,"If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.",No
17600,"I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.",No
17601,"With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.",No
17602,"All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.",Yes
17605,"Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.",No
17606,"I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.",Yes
17607,They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.,No
17608,"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?",No
17612,"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, ""Oh, no, there you go again, Mr.",Yes
17614,And what did you do right after the election?,No
17615,You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.,Yes
17616,"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know.",No
17617,"[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?",Yes
17618,You've got a $260 billion deficit.,Yes
17620,You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --,No
17625,"With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.",No
17626,"And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.",Yes
17627,And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.,Yes
17630,I gave you back some of that time.,No
17643,"Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.",No
17644,"Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.",Yes
17645,"It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.",Yes
17647,"We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.",Yes
17648,It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.,No
17650,"We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.",Yes
17651,"We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.",Yes
17652,We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.,Yes
17653,We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.,Yes
17654,"Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.",No
17656,"But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.",Yes
17657,We didn't think that was right.,No
17658,"And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.",No
17659,"So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.",Yes
17660,"7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",Yes
17668,"I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.",No
17669,"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.",No
17670,And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.,No
17671,"So, that was the only place that that was used.",No
17672,"I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.",No
17673,"There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.",No
17674,"We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.",No
17678,"Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.",No
17679,"Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.",No
17680,"I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.",No
17682,"If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.",No
17683,The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.,No
17684,"The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.",No
17685,There is no question that the poor are worse off.,No
17687,But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.,Yes
17688,"How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.",No
17689,"Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.",No
17690,One final point if I might.,No
17691,"There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.",No
17693,That's another reason to get the deficit down.,No
17696,I think they stand for civil rights.,No
17697,"I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.",No
17698,They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.,No
17699,I think the business community wants to get involved.,No
17700,I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.,No
17701,I think that's part of it.,No
17702,I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.,No
17703,"I'm opposed to that, too.",No
17707,The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.,Yes
17708,"There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.",Yes
17709,"And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.",No
17711,"Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.",No
17712,The interest rates are based on inflation.,No
17713,And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.,No
17714,"I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.",No
17715,"Well, it isn't going to go back up.",No
17716,We're going to see that it doesn't.,No
17717,And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.,No
17719,"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.",No
17720,"I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.",No
17722,"But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.",Yes
17723,"And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.",Yes
17724,"Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.",No
17725,Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.,Yes
17726,"Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.",No
17727,That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.,No
17728,It's causing high interest rates.,No
17729,It's ruining us in trade.,No
17730,It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.,Yes
17731,The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --,Yes
17743,Do you want to give me some suggestions?,No
17744,[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.,No
17745,I'm going to give the President some credit.,No
17746,"I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.",No
17747,"What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.",No
17748,"I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.",No
17751,"And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.",No
17754,"Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.",Yes
17755,"And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.",No
17756,"Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.",No
17757,It was once called voodoo economics.,No
17758,"I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.",No
17759,"Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.",Yes
17760,This is how I'm going to get it done.,No
17761,"Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.",No
17762,"It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.",No
17763,And give us a plan.,No
17765,Whose taxes will you raise?,No
17767,Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?,No
17768,"If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.",No
17769,And that's the way it should be.,No
17770,The American people would be in charge.,No
17772,"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.",No
17774,And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.,No
17775,"And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.",No
17776,"But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.",No
17777,"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?",No
17778,Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?'',No
17779,And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.,No
17780,"Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?",No
17786,"Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.",No
17787,I told you never would I do such a thing.,No
17788,"But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.",Yes
17789,Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.,Yes
17790,"If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.",Yes
17791,It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.,Yes
17792,"So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.",No
17793,"Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.",No
17794,"And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.",No
17795,And none of these things happened.,Yes
17796,"It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.",Yes
17797,"As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.",No
17798,"But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.",Yes
17800,"Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.",Yes
17801,"In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.",Yes
17802,"Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.",Yes
17803,"That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.",No
17804,And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.,No
17805,That's why I want another 4 years.,No
17807,"Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.",No
17808,And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.,No
17809,"[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.",No
17811,"But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.",No
17812,In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.,Yes
17813,This administration seems to run that every morning.,No
17814,And the result is exactly what we see.,No
17815,This economy is starting to run downhill.,No
17817,"Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.",Yes
17818,Growth is a little over 3 percent now.,Yes
17819,Many people are predicting a recession.,No
17820,And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.,No
17821,"We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.",No
17830,"No, I might as well just go with -- --",No
17842,"Well, we'll include it in that.",No
17844,"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question.",No
17845,"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''",No
17846,"The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.",No
17847,"Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.",No
17848,"I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.",No
17849,"The question, I think, should be enlarged.",No
17851,"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''",No
17852,I promised a new beginning.,No
17853,"So far, it is only a beginning.",No
17854,"If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.",No
17856,The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.,Yes
17857,Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.,Yes
17859,"Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.",Yes
17860,"In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.",Yes
17861,By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.,Yes
17862,We have restored much of our economy.,Yes
17863,"With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.",Yes
17864,"So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.",No
17865,"We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.",Yes
17866,We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.,No
17867,"Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.",Yes
17868,But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots.,No
17869,"We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts.",No
17870,Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.,Yes
17871,We have 543 at present.,Yes
17872,"We have -- our military, the morale is high.",No
17873,"I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.",Yes
17874,"And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.",No
17875,"But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.",No
17876,"There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.",No
17877,"Well, we are the ones who found those.",No
17878,I think we've given the American people back their spirit.,No
17879,"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''",No
17882,I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.,No
17884,"He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.",No
17885,The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?,No
17886,"Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.",No
17887,"If you're middle income, you're about where you were.",No
17888,"And if you're modest income, you're worse off.",No
17889,That's what the economists tell us.,No
17890,But is that really the question that should be asked?,No
17891,Isn't the real question is will we be better off?,No
17892,Will our children be better off?,No
17893,Are we building the future that this nation needs?,No
17894,"I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.",No
17895,Are we better of with this arms race?,No
17896,Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?,No
17897,Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?,No
17899,Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?,Yes
17900,"Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?",No
17901,I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.,No
17902,I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.,No
17903,"And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.",No
17904,"When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.",Yes
17905,"America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.",Yes
17906,I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.,No
17907,I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.,No
17908,"And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.",No
17909,"These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.",No
17910,That's not fair for our future.,No
17911,"I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.",No
17912,I believe in opening doors.,No
17913,"We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women.",No
17914,I have been for those efforts all my life.,No
17915,The President's record is quite different.,No
17916,The question is our future.,No
17917,"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''",No
17918,"We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.",No
17959,"But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.",No
17960,I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us.,No
17961,And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.,No
17962,You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.,No
17963,Our hearts go out to you.,No
17964,And we admire your pluck and perseverance.,No
17965,I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.,No
17966,And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.,No
17967,But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.,No
17968,I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.,No
17969,I'll never give a veto to any country over our security.,No
17970,But I also know how to lead those alliances.,No
17972,"I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.",No
17973,I have a better plan for homeland security.,No
17974,"I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.",No
17975,I know I can do a better job in Iraq.,No
17976,"I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.",Yes
17977,"We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.",No
17978,"All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.",No
17980,"I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.",No
17981,September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.,No
17982,"And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.",Yes
17983,We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.,No
17984,Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice.,Yes
17985,The rest of them know we're after them.,No

17991,America and the world are safer for it.,No
17992,We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.,No
17995,Khan network has been brought to justice.,No
17996,"And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.",No
17997,Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.,No
17998,Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.,No
18001,"No, I don't believe it's going to happen.",No
18002,"I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.",No
18003,I've shown the American people I know how to lead.,No
18004,I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.,No
18005,And I made some tough decisions.,No
18006,But people know where I stand.,No
18008,And that's how best it is to keep the peace.,No
18009,This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.,No
18010,And that's what they are.,No
18011,"This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.",No
18012,We have a duty to defeat this enemy.,No
18013,We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.,No
18014,"The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.",No
18015,And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.,No
18016,Ten million citizens have registered to vote.,Yes
18018,"That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.",No
18019,Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.,Yes
18020,"In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.",No
18024,Because an enemy realizes the stakes.,No
18025,The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.,No
18026,That's why they're fighting so vociferously.,No
18027,"They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.",No
18028,And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.,No
18029,They're trying to defeat us.,No
18030,"And if we lose our will, we lose.",No
18031,"But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.",No
18033,I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.,No
18034,"And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.",No
18035,"But we also have to be smart, Jim.",No
18036,"And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.",Yes
18037,"This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment.",No
18038,And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.,No
18039,"I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.",Yes
18040,And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.,No
18041,"Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.",Yes
18043,"But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.",Yes
18044,The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.,Yes
18049,"Well, where do you want me to begin?",No
18050,"First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.",No
18051,"In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.",No
18052,"And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.",Yes
18053,"Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.",No
18054,We had Saddam Hussein trapped.,No
18055,He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.,Yes
18056,"Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.",No
18058,"You've got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, ""I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.""",No
18059,I don't believe the United States did that.,No
18060,And we pushed our allies aside.,No
18061,"And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.",Yes
18062,And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.,No
18063,"The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.",Yes
18064,"The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.",Yes
18065,"Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?",No
18068,My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.,Yes
18069,He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.,Yes
18071,The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.,No
18072,I was hoping diplomacy would work.,No
18073,I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.,No
18075,So I went to the United Nations.,No
18076,I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.,No
18077,I decided to go there myself.,No
18078,"And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.",No
18079,"They passed the resolution that said, ""Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.""",No
18080,"I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.",No
18081,Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.,No
18083,He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place.,Yes
18084,"As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.",No
18085,The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.,Yes
18086,That wasn't going to work.,No
18087,"That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.",No
18088,He was hoping we'd turn away.,No
18089,But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.,No
18091,The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.,No
18095,"Jim, we've got the capability of doing both.",No
18096,"As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.",Yes
18097,"We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.",No
18098,"And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.",No
18099,"That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.",No
18100,But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.,No
18101,Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.,No
18103,Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.,Yes
18104,"The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.",Yes
18106,But the front on this war is more than just one place.,No
18107,The Philippines -- we've got help -- we're helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.,Yes
18108,"And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.",No
18109,That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.,No
18110,Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.,No
18111,The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.,No
18113,We've got a plan to do so.,No
18114,And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.,No
18115,I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.,No
18116,"He's a strong, courageous leader.",No
18118,"He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.",No
18119,"He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.",No
18121,There will be elections in January.,No
18123,And our alliance is strong.,No
18124,That's the plan for victory.,No
18125,"And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",No
18127,The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.,No
18128,Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.,Yes
18129,The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.,Yes
18130,And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.,Yes
18131,"Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.",No
18132,You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.,No
18133,You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.,No
18134,"I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.",Yes
18135,Some of them got it for a birthday present.,No
18137,"Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.",Yes
18138,And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.,No
18140,But it's getting worse by the day.,No
18141,More soldiers killed in June than before.,Yes
18142,More in July than June.,Yes
18143,More in August than July.,Yes
18144,More in September than in August.,Yes
18145,And now we see beheadings.,No
18146,"And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up.",Yes
18147,And we don't have enough troops there.,No
18148,Can I respond to that?,No
18152,"First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.",Yes
18153,"I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.",No
18154,What message does that send our troops?,No
18155,What message does that send to our allies?,No
18156,What message does that send the Iraqis?,No
18157,"No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.",No
18159,"Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.",No
18160,"And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.",No
18162,We can't leave a failed Iraq.,No
18163,But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.,No
18166,But I don't believe this president can.,No
18167,I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what's necessary to make it so America isn't doing this alone.,No
18172,"Jim, let me tell you exactly what I'll do.",No
18173,And there are a long list of thing.,No
18174,"First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?",Yes
18175,"What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.",Yes
18176,"The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.",Yes
18177,That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.,Yes
18178,We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.,No
18179,"The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.",Yes
18180,"Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.",Yes
18181,Does that make you feel safer in America?,No
18182,This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.,Yes
18184,I believe in protecting America first.,No
18185,"And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.",Yes
18186,"The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.",Yes
18187,And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.,No
18188,"That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.",No
18189,"Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.",No
18190,I'm going to do it in four years.,No
18191,And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.,No
18193,I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.,No
18194,It's like a huge tax gap.,No
18195,"Anyway, that's for another debate.",No
18196,My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.,Yes
18197,My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.,Yes
18198,"We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.",Yes
18200,"We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.",Yes
18201,We're doing our duty to provide the funding.,No
18202,But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.,No
18203,"You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.",No
18204,And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.,No
18205,There's a lot of good people working hard.,No
18206,"And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.",Yes
18208,We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.,No
18209,The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.,No
18210,"But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",No
18212,The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.,No
18213,"We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.",Yes
18214,On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.,No
18215,And the test is not whether you're spending more money.,No
18216,"The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?",No
18217,We didn't need that tax cut.,No
18218,America needed to be safe.,No
18219,Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.,No
18220,I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.,No
18222,"I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.",No
18223,There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.,No
18229,Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.,No
18230,And that's what we're doing.,Yes
18231,"We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.",Yes
18232,That is the best way.,No
18233,We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.,No
18234,I believe they want to.,No
18235,Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.,No
18236,"And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.",No
18237,"And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.",No
18238,And I hope it's as soon as possible.,No
18239,But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.,No
18240,"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months.""",Yes
18241,You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.,No
18242,"My message to our troops is, ""Thank you for what you're doing.",No
18243,We're standing with you strong.,No
18244,We'll give you all the equipment you need.,No
18245,"And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission.""",No
18246,"A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.",No
18247,A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.,No
18248,A free Iraq will help secure Israel.,No
18249,A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.,No
18250,A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.,No
18253,"My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.",No
18254,I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.,No
18256,"When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.",No
18257,And they both looked at me and said: We need you.,No
18258,You've got to help us over there.,No
18259,Now I believe there's a better way to do this.,No
18260,"You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.",No
18261,"And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.",Yes
18262,And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.,No
18263,That's exactly where we find ourselves today.,No
18264,There's a sense of American occupation.,No
18265,The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.,Yes
18266,We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.,Yes
18267,"We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.",No
18268,We didn't guard the borders.,No
18269,"Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.",No
18270,I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.,No
18271,And I believe our troops need other allies helping.,No
18272,I'm going to hold that summit.,No
18273,"I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.",No
18276,I think it's worthy for a follow-up.,No
18281,"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?",No
18282,"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion.""",No
18283,"As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.",Yes
18284,Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.,No
18286,"Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.",No
18287,But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.,No
18289,"I believe that when you know something's going wrong, you make it right.",No
18290,That's what I learned in Vietnam.,No
18291,When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.,No
18292,"Some people don't like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did.",No
18293,And that's what I did with that vote.,No
18294,And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.,No
18299,"No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.",No
18300,I believe that we have to win this.,No
18301,The president and I have always agreed on that.,No
18302,"And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.",Yes
18303,But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.,No
18304,"Then the president, in fact, promised them.",Yes
18305,"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully.",No
18307,We will not make war inevitable.,No
18308,"We will go with our allies.""",No
18309,He didn't do any of those things.,No
18310,They didn't do the planning.,No
18311,They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.,No
18312,They avoided even the advice of their own general.,Yes
18313,"General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.",Yes
18314,"Instead of listening to him, they retired him.",Yes
18315,"The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, ""Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.""",Yes
18316,That's what we have here.,No
18317,And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.,No
18318,They do have stakes in it.,No
18319,They've always had stakes in it.,No
18320,The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war.,No
18321,The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.,No
18322,But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.,Yes
18323,"In fact, he's done the opposite.",Yes
18325,"When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, ""No, no, we'll go do this alone.""",No
18326,"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction.""",Yes
18327,That's not a way to invite people.,No
18330,"Of course, the U.N. was invited in.",Yes
18331,And we support the U.N. efforts there.,No
18332,They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.,Yes
18333,But they're now back in helping with elections.,No
18334,My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.,Yes
18335,What's he say to Tony Blair?,No
18336,What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?,No
18337,You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.,No
18338,"Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.",Yes
18339,"So what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq.",No
18341,"Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?""",No
18342,I know how these people think.,No
18343,I deal with them all the time.,No
18344,I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.,No
18345,"They're not going to follow somebody who says, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.""",No
18346,They're not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.,No
18347,They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.,No
18348,"And finally, he says we ought to have a summit.",No
18349,"Well, there are summits being held.",No
18350,Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged.,Yes
18351,"And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.",No
18352,"And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.",No
18353,And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.,No
18355,"The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.",No
18356,And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.,No
18358,"Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.",Yes
18359,That's not a grand coalition.,No
18362,"Well, actually, he forgot Poland.",No
18363,"And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.",Yes
18364,And I honor their sacrifices.,No
18365,And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.,No
18366,You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us.,No
18367,He called them coerced and the bribed.,No
18368,That's not how you bring people together.,No
18370,"It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.",No
18374,"No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.",Yes
18375,"I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.",No
18376,"But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.",Yes
18377,"I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn't.",No
18378,And now we're fighting them now.,Yes
18382,I see on the TV screens how hard it is.,No
18385,"See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time.",No
18386,I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.,No
18387,"I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.",No
18388,We've got a plan in place.,No
18389,"The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be.",No
18390,"The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.",Yes
18391,"And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.",No
18392,We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.,Yes
18393,And we're making progress there.,Yes
18394,And our alliance is strong.,No
18395,"And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.",No
18396,Japan will be hosting a summit.,No
18399,It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy.,No
18400,"It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.",No
18402,And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.,No
18404,What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.,No
18405,"But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.",Yes
18408,So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.,No
18409,The truth is what good policy is based on.,No
18411,The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.,Yes
18413,"But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.",Yes
18414,"You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.",No
18416,"And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs.",Yes
18417,"And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.",Yes
18419,"The president is the one that said, ""We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons.""",Yes
18426,"Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.",No
18427,And I try not to.,No
18428,I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.,No
18429,And I'll tell you exactly how.,No
18430,"First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.",Yes
18431,We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.,Yes
18432,I just described the coalition.,No
18433,It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.,No
18434,The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.,No
18436,"He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.",Yes
18437,And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.,No
18438,They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.,No
18439,"Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.",Yes
18441,He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.,No
18442,We did not go as a last resort.,No
18443,And most Americans know the difference.,No
18444,"Now, this has cost us deeply in the world.",No
18445,I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.,No
18446,"I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.",Yes
18447,"And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.",No
18448,"And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.",No
18449,We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.,No
18450,We need to deny them the recruits.,No
18451,We need to deny them the safe havens.,No
18452,We need to rebuild our alliances.,No
18453,"I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.",No
18455,My opponent just said something amazing.,No
18456,He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.,Yes
18457,Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.,No
18458,Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.,No
18460,I decided the right action was in Iraq.,No
18461,My opponent calls it a mistake.,No
18463,He said I misled on Iraq.,No
18464,I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.,No
18465,I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.,No
18466,"I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.",No
18467,I don't think he was misleading.,No
18468,I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.,No
18470,"As the politics change, his positions change.",No
18471,And that's not how a commander in chief acts.,No
18473,"The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence.",No
18474,"And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force.",No
18477,I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.,No
18478,Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.,Yes
18479,"I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.",No
18480,There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.,No
18481,And the president chose the wrong way.,No
18483,The only thing consistent about my opponent's position is that he's been inconsistent.,No
18485,And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.,No
18486,And I expect to win.,No
18488,We're being challenged like never before.,No
18489,"And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.",No
18493,"You know, every life is precious.",No
18495,"You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.",No
18496,"You know, I think about Missy Johnson.",No
18497,"She's a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina.",No
18498,"She and her son Bryan, they came to see me.",No
18499,Her husband PJ got killed.,No
18500,"He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.",No
18501,"You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.",No
18502,I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.,No
18503,Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror.,No
18504,I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.,No
18505,We must deal with threats before they fully materialize.,No
18506,"And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.",No
18508,That's what she told me her husband understood.,No
18511,That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.,No
18513,"But I think it's worth it, Jim.",No
18514,"I think it's worth it, because I think -- I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that's desperate for freedom.",No
18515,It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.,No
18517,"I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.",No
18518,"And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war.",No
18519,"And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.",No
18521,"And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.",No
18523,That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.,No
18524,And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.,No
18525,"Now, we have a choice here.",No
18526,"I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.",No
18527,There's only 25 percent of the people in there.,Yes
18528,They can't have an election right now.,No
18529,The president's not getting the job done.,No
18530,"So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president's plan, which is four words: more of the same.",No
18531,I think my plan is better.,No
18532,And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.,No
18533,"I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.",No
18536,"Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief.",No
18537,"And if I were to ever say, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?",No
18538,"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion.""",No
18539,It's not a grand diversion.,No
18540,This is an essential that we get it right.,No
18541,"And so, the plan he talks about simply won't work.",No
18545,"Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.",No
18546,"Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.",No
18547,It's the wrong thing to do.,No
18549,And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.,No
18550,Now that's what we have to do.,No
18552,Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.,No
18553,"I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.",No
18554,But I have a plan to do it.,No
18559,"The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.",No
18560,I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.,Yes
18561,"I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.",No
18562,And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.,No
18563,"As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.",Yes
18564,"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil.""",No
18565,"Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly.",No
18566,And these are the things you have to think through.,No
18567,What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.,No
18568,"And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.",No
18569,You have to close the borders.,No
18570,You've got to show you're serious in that regard.,No
18571,But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.,No
18572,I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.,No
18573,And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.,No
18574,"But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.",No
18575,"Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.",Yes
18576,"Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards.",No
18577,"""Oops, we haven't done the job.",No
18578,We have to start to spend the money now.,No
18579,"Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?""",No
18581,"There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.",Yes
18582,"There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year.",Yes
18583,"Yes, we're getting the job done.",No
18585,"Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.",No
18586,"Now, my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground.",No
18587,"Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.",No
18588,He is the leader of that country.,No
18590,"When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.",No
18591,You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.,No
18592,One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.,No
18593,"That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.",No
18594,"The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.",No
18596,"I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.",No
18597,"I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject the notion that some say that if you're Muslim you can't free, you don't desire freedom.",No
18598,"I disagree, strongly disagree with that.",No
18600,I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.,No
18601,"But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.",No
18602,He has more of the same.,No
18603,"Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.",No
18605,"The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.",Yes
18609,The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.,Yes
18610,They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.,No
18611,They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.,No
18612,And those are the stakes.,No
18613,And that's why it is essential we not leave.,No
18614,That's why it's essential we hold the line.,No
18615,That's why it's essential we win.,No
18617,Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.,No
18621,I would hope I never have to.,No
18622,I understand how hard it is to commit troops.,No
18623,Never wanted to commit troops.,No
18624,"When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I'd be doing that.",No
18625,"But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.",No
18626,"I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.",No
18628,It must -- as a last resort.,No
18629,I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.,No
18631,There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.,No
18632,"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, ""Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out.",No
18633,"Maybe an 18th resolution would work,"" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off.",No
18634,"There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.",No
18635,"So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.",No
18636,And I would hope to never have to use force.,No
18637,"But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.",No
18640,Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.,Yes
18641,Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.,No
18642,"So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.",No
18643,"I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.",No
18645,"Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.",No
18646,"In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, ""The enemy attacked us.""",No
18647,Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.,Yes
18648,Osama bin Laden attacked us.,Yes
18650,"And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains.",Yes
18651,"With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.",No
18652,"They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.",Yes
18653,That's the enemy that attacked us.,No
18654,That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.,No
18655,"That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.",Yes
18656,He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.,Yes
18657,That is just factually incorrect.,Yes
18658,Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.,Yes
18659,We would have had sanctions.,No
18660,We would have had the U.N. inspectors.,No
18661,Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.,No
18662,"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?""",No
18663,we'd be in a stronger place today.,No
18665,"First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.",No
18667,"And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.",No
18668,It just shows a significant difference of opinion.,No
18671,He was hoping to turn a blind eye.,No
18672,"And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.",No
18673,"He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.",No
18675,Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.,Yes
18676,"And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.",Yes
18677,Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.,No
18679,The world is more dangerous.,No
18680,I'd have made a better choice.,No
18684,"The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike.",Yes
18685,That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War.,No
18686,And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.,No
18687,"No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.",Yes
18688,"But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons.",No
18689,Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations.,Yes
18690,"I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle.",No
18691,"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos.""",No
18692,"And DeGaulle waved them off and said, ""No, no, no, no.",No
18693,"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me.""",No
18694,"How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we've done, in that way?",No
18695,So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world.,No
18696,And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous -- Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous.,No
18697,"Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.",No
18698,"But I'll tell you this: As president, I'll never take my eye off that ball.",No
18699,I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.,Yes
18700,And we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table.,No
18701,"You don't help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations.",No
18702,You have to earn that respect.,No
18703,And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.,No
18705,"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test.",No
18706,"My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.",No
18707,My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.,No
18708,"Let me tell you one thing I didn't sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions.",No
18709,"And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.",No
18710,This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.,Yes
18711,And I wouldn't join it.,No
18712,And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.,No
18713,But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.,No
18714,My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.,Yes
18715,"I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.",No
18716,I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.,No
18717,But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.,No
18721,"North Korea, first, I do.",No
18722,Let me say -- I certainly hope so.,No
18723,"Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.",Yes
18724,And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.,Yes
18725,"And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.",No
18726,"And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.",Yes
18727,"And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.",No
18728,"And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.",Yes
18729,"As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.",No
18730,"So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.",Yes
18731,"And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.",No
18732,And I think this will work.,No
18733,It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.,No
18735,"He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.",No
18736,"On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.",No
18737,"We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.",Yes
18739,There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.,Yes
18740,I hope we can do it.,No
18741,And we've got a good strategy.,No
18743,"With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.",Yes
18744,I believe we could have done better.,No
18745,"I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.",No
18746,"If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.",No
18748,"With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.",Yes
18749,Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.,Yes
18750,And we knew where the fuel rods were.,Yes
18751,And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.,No
18752,"Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.",Yes
18753,The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.,Yes
18754,And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.,No
18755,"And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.",Yes
18756,"While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.",Yes
18757,"And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.",Yes
18758,That happened on this president's watch.,Yes
18759,"Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.",No
18765,"I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.",No
18769,That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.,No
18770,"And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.",No
18771,The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.,Yes
18772,That's what we caught him doing.,Yes
18773,That's where he was breaking the agreement.,Yes
18774,"Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.",Yes
18775,We can't sanction them any more.,No
18776,There are sanctions in place on Iran.,Yes
18777,"And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.",Yes
18785,"Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.",No
18786,"Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.",Yes
18787,"In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.",No
18788,And that's the difference between the president and me.,No
18789,"And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.",No
18790,"Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.",Yes
18791,"And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.",Yes
18792,I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.,No
18793,"Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.",No
18794,Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.,Yes
18795,We need to do more than that.,No
18796,They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.,No
18797,And that's going to require more than is on the table today.,No
18798,I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.,No
18799,Ask the people in the armed forces today.,No
18800,We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.,Yes
18801,"We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.",Yes
18802,So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.,No
18803,"That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.",No
18804,I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.,No
18805,"And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.",No
18806,"But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.",No
18807,It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.,No
18809,"Back to Iran, just for a second.",No
18810,It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.,Yes
18811,"That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.",No
18812,"In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.",No
18813,And Colin Powell so stated.,Yes
18814,We have committed $200 million worth of aid.,Yes
18815,We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.,Yes
18816,We will commit more over time to help.,No
18817,We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.,Yes
18818,"Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.",Yes
18819,I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.,No
18820,We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.,No
18821,"We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.",Yes
18822,My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.,No
18823,"And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.",No
18828,"Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.",No
18829,I admire the fact that he is a great dad.,No
18830,"I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.",No
18831,I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.,No
18832,Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.,No
18833,I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.,No
18834,There's nothing wrong with that.,No
18835,"My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.",Yes
18836,"He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.",No
18837,You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.,No
18838,Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.,No
18839,Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.,No
18840,Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.,No
18841,And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.,No
18843,"But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.",No
18844,"Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.",No
18846,"Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.",No
18847,And I share them with him.,No
18848,I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.,No
18850,And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.,No
18851,I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.,No
18854,I'm trying to put a leash on them.,No
18857,I've learned not to do that.,No
18862,... and a great first lady.,No
18863,But we do have differences.,No
18864,I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.,No
18865,I don't think that's my job or my business.,No
18866,But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.,No
18867,"Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.",No
18868,But this issue of certainty.,No
18869,"It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.",No
18870,"It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.",No
18871,"What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.",Yes
18872,And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.,No
18874,"Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.",No
18875,Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.,Yes
18876,But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.,No
18877,"And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.",No
18878,"Otherwise, the world won't be better off.",No
18880,I have no intention of wilting.,No
18881,I've never wilted in my life.,No
18882,And I've never wavered in my life.,No
18883,"I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.",No
18884,He needed to be disarmed.,No
18885,We needed to go to the U.N.,No
18886,"The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.",Yes
18887,But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.,No
18892,There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.,Yes
18893,"At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.",No
18894,I did a lot of work on this.,No
18895,"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network.",No
18896,"And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.",Yes
18897,And the black market sale price was about $250 million.,Yes
18898,"Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.",No
18899,"And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.",Yes
18900,We have to do this job.,No
18901,"And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.",No
18902,The president actually cut the money for it.,Yes
18903,You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.,No
18904,And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.,No
18905,Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.,Yes
18906,The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.,Yes
18908,You talk about mixed messages.,No
18909,"We're telling other people, ""You can't have nuclear weapons,"" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.",Yes
18911,"I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.",No
18912,And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.,No
18913,And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.,No
18914,This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.,No
18916,And I intend to get it done.,No
18919,"Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.",No
18920,And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.,No
18921,My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.,No
18922,Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.,No
18926,This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.,Yes
18927,We convinced Libya to disarm.,Yes
18928,It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.,No
18929,I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.,No
18930,And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.,Yes
18931,We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.,No
18932,And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.,No
18935,In the hands of a terrorist enemy.,No
18936,"Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.",No
18937,"But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.",Yes
18938,"And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.",No
18939,"I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",No
18941,"Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",No
18942,It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.,No
18943,It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.,No
18944,"It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",No
18945,It's a big mistake to do that.,No
18946,"We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.",No
18947,"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",No
18948,I don't think that'll work.,No
18954,"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.",No
18955,"I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.",No
18956,"I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.",No
18957,"He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.",Yes
18958,"That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.",No
18959,That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.,No
18960,"That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.",No
18961,I've got a good relation with Vladimir.,No
18962,"And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.",No
18963,"I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.",No
18964,And so I've told him my opinion.,No
18965,"I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.",No
18966,Russia is a country in transition.,No
18967,Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.,No
18968,"And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.",No
18969,And I will continue working with him over the next four years.,No
18971,"Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.",No
18972,"And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.",Yes
18973,It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.,No
18974,I regret what's happened in these past months.,No
18975,And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.,No
18976,Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.,Yes
18977,His political opposition is being put in jail.,Yes
18978,"And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.",No
18979,This is a very important country to us.,No
18981,But we always have to stand up for democracy.,No
18982,"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.""",No
18983,"Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.",No
18984,Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.,No
18985,"Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.",No
18986,"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.",Yes
18987,We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.,No
18988,And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.,No
18989,"Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.",No
18991,You know my opinion on North Korea.,No
18992,I can't say it any more plainly.,No
18998,"Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.",No
18999,I don't take it personally.,No
19001,"You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.",Yes
19002,And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.,No
19003,"I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.",No
19007,"The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.",Yes
19008,Those words really have to mean something.,No
19009,"And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.",No
19010,Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.,Yes
19011,It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.,No
19014,"Thank you, Jim, very much.",No
19015,"Thank you very much to the university, again.",No
19017,"My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.",No
19018,"There's no doubt, I think, about that.",No
19019,But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.,No
19020,"I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.",No
19021,"And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.",No
19022,But I have a difference with this president.,No
19023,I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.,No
19024,I have a plan for Iraq.,No
19025,I believe we can be successful.,No
19026,I'm not talking about leaving.,No
19028,"And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.",No
19029,"I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.",No
19030,"I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.",No
19031,That's the country that I'm going to fight for.,No
19032,And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.,No
19033,"I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.",No
19037,"Thank you very much tonight, Jim.",No
19039,"If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.",No
19040,"That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.",No
19041,The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.,No
19042,We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.,No
19043,We will reform our military.,No
19044,The military will be an all-volunteer army.,No
19045,We will continue to stay on the offense.,No
19046,We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.,No
19047,We'll continue to build our alliances.,No
19048,"I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.",No
19049,And we'll continue to spread freedom.,No
19050,I believe in the transformational power of liberty.,No
19051,I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.,No
19052,I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.,No
19053,And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.,No
19054,We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.,No
19055,"We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.",No
19056,We've climbed the mighty mountain.,No
19057,"I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.",No
19058,"By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.",No
19060,I ask for your vote.,No
19089,"And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.",No
19090,"I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.",No
19091,Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.,No
19092,"I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.",No
19093,I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.,No
19094,Four years ago you took me on faith.,No
19095,"Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.",Yes
19096,We are better off than we were four years ago.,Yes
19098,We cut the deficit by 60 percent.,Yes
19099,"Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",No
19100,We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.,Yes
19101,"Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.",No
19102,We passed family and medical leave.,Yes
19103,Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.,No
19104,"We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.",Yes
19105,Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.,No
19107,Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.,No
19108,"And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.",No
19109,We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.,No
19110,And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.,No
19113,"Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.",No
19114,"Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.",No
19115,It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.,No
19116,I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.,No
19117,"I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.",No
19118,I've learned from them that people do have tough times.,No
19119,And sometimes you can't go it alone.,No
19120,And that's what America is all about.,No
19121,I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .,No
19122,"And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.",No
19123,America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.,No
19124,"Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.",No
19125,You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.,No
19126,"You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.",No
19127,"But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.",No
19128,And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.,No
19129,"Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.",No
19130,"Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.",No
19131,And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.,No
19132,"It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.",No
19136,"Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.",No
19137,"That, to me, is the key.",No
19138,And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.,No
19139,"For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.",Yes
19140,"We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.",Yes
19141,"But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.",Yes
19142,"All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.",Yes
19143,I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.,No
19144,"I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.",Yes
19145,"I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.",Yes
19146,I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.,Yes
19147,"These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.",No
19149,"I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.",No
19150,The President trusts the government.,No
19151,We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.,No
19152,"One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.",Yes
19153,"Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.",Yes
19154,"A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America.",Yes
19156,"If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.",Yes
19157,"We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.",Yes
19158,I guess I rely more on the individual.,No
19159,I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.,No
19160,"Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.",No
19161,That's my difference with the President.,No
19162,We'll have specific differences later.,No
19163,"He noted a few, but there are others.",No
19166,We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.,Yes
19167,"But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.",No
19168,"I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.",Yes
19169,Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.,Yes
19170,But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.,No
19173,"Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.",Yes
19176,"And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.",No
19177,I looked at the slowest growth in the century.,Yes
19178,"He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.",Yes
19179,We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.,Yes
19181,"In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.",Yes
19182,"Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.",Yes
19184,We have the highest foreign debt in history.,Yes
19185,"And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?",No
19186,"Well, I guess some may be better off.",No
19187,Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.,No
19188,Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.,No
19189,But are the American people?,No
19190,They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.,Yes
19191,"For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.",Yes
19192,"More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.",Yes
19193,So some may be better off.,No
19194,They talk about family income being up.,No
19195,"That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.",Yes
19196,And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.,No
19197,"One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.",No
19198,"We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.",No
19199,That's what America is all about.,No
19201,"Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.",Yes
19202,"We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.",Yes
19203,Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.,Yes
19204,We have record numbers of new small businesses.,Yes
19205,We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.,Yes
19206,All groups of people are growing.,No
19207,We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.,Yes
19208,The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.,Yes
19209,So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.,No
19210,Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.,No
19211,"How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.",No
19212,That's what I want to focus on.,No
19213,"But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.",No
19215,I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.,No
19216,"But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.",No
19217,"We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.",No
19218,"It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.",No
19219,"Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.",No
19220,Are your children getting a better education.,No
19221,Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.,Yes
19222,"Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.",Yes
19223,"So, yes, some may be better off.",No
19224,"But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.",No
19228,Let's look at the position.,No
19229,"First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.",Yes
19230,"He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.",No
19232,"Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.",Yes
19233,It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.,Yes
19234,"The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.",Yes
19235,"And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.",Yes
19236,"Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.",Yes
19237,And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.,No
19238,But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.,No
19239,"We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.",No
19241,"Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.",Yes
19242,I thought it was a good program.,No
19243,But I've supported Medicare ever since.,Yes
19244,"In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.",No
19245,I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.,No
19246,"In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.",No
19248,"I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.",No
19249,"It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.",No
19250,He doesn't fix it for ten years.,Yes
19251,"We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.",Yes
19252,"And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.",No
19253,"Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.",No
19254,You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.,Yes
19255,I think it's time to have a truce.,No
19257,"Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.",No
19258,"But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.",Yes
19259,I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.,Yes
19260,My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.,Yes
19261,"We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.",No
19267,"And so will the former President, yes.",No
19269,"Well, the people need it, that's the point.",No
19270,This is not a Wall Street tax cut.,No
19271,This is a family tax cut.,No
19272,"This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.",Yes
19273,"Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.",No
19274,This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.,No
19275,"First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.",Yes
19276,"He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.",Yes
19277,It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.,No
19278,"It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent.",Yes
19279,So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.,No
19280,It's a state tax relief.,Yes
19281,It's a $500 per child tax credit.,Yes
19283,"Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.",Yes
19284,"In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.",No
19285,And it's also regulatory reform.,No
19286,"It's a good package, Mr. President.",No
19287,We'd like to have your support.,No
19289,"Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.",Yes
19290,"It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.",Yes
19291,It's not good to raise the deficit.,No
19292,We worked too hard to lower it.,No
19293,"It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.",Yes
19294,"So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.",No
19295,The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.,Yes
19296,"I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.",No
19297,I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.,No
19298,"We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.",Yes
19299,You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.,No
19300,"It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.",No
19303,"Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.",No
19304,The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.,No
19305,"In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.",Yes
19306,And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.,No
19307,"Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.",No
19308,"Now, let me just give you an example.",No
19309,"I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.",Yes
19310,The drunk driver had no money.,No
19311,"Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.",Yes
19312,I thought that was wrong.,No
19313,"So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.",No
19314,But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.,No
19315,I've done a lot of things that were controversial.,No
19316,"My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.",Yes
19317,Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.,No
19318,That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.,No
19320,How does he avoid conflict?,No
19321,"Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.",No
19322,"I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.",No
19323,"Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.",No
19324,I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.,No
19325,"The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.",No
19326,We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.,No
19327,"But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.",No
19328,I don't dislike trial lawyers.,No
19329,But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.,No
19330,You're putting a lot of business people out of business.,No
19331,"Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.",Yes
19332,"I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.",No
19333,"So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.",Yes
19334,"And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.",No
19335,And I will address you as Mr. President.,No
19336,You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.,Yes
19338,"Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.",Yes
19339,I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.,No
19340,"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.",Yes
19341,"And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.",Yes
19342,"That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",Yes
19344,So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.,No
19345,I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.,No
19347,I think it's very difficult.,No
19348,Let's be honest about it.,No
19349,That's why we need campaign finance reform.,No
19350,That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.,No
19351,"We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.",No
19352,And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.,No
19353,"Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.",Yes
19354,"I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.",No
19355,We tried six or eight years ago.,Yes
19356,"He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.",Yes
19357,"We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.",No
19358,"You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.",Yes
19359,We have a commission on campaign finance reform.,No
19360,"They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.",No
19362,"We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.",No
19363,But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.,No
19364,I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.,No
19365,But I want to go back to 1965.,No
19366,That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.,Yes
19367,And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.,Yes
19368,We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.,Yes
19369,All 50 states did it.,Yes
19370,It took three and a half years.,Yes
19371,"It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.",Yes
19372,"What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?",Yes
19373,"Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.",Yes
19374,It seems to me that you have a selective memory.,No
19375,"You know, mine doesn't work that way.",No
19376,So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.,No
19377,"Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.",No
19378,But let me respond to what you said.,No
19379,I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.,No
19380,That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.,No
19381,"So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.",No
19382,"And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.",Yes
19383,"And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.",Yes
19385,And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.,Yes
19386,And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.,No
19387,"So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.",Yes
19388,"And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.",No
19390,"Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.",No
19391,Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.,No
19392,"Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.",No
19393,These are sophisticated people watching tonight.,No
19394,Millions and millions of Americans.,No
19395,They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.,No
19396,They know the Democratic party won't do it.,No
19397,We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.,No
19398,"And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.",No
19402,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.",No
19404,But let's look at the overall record.,No
19405,"Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.",Yes
19406,"The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.",Yes
19407,Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.,No
19408,I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.,Yes
19409,"The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.",No
19410,We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.,Yes
19411,We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.,Yes
19412,"We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.",Yes
19413,And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.,Yes
19414,"Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.",No
19415,Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.,Yes
19416,I think we all do.,No
19418,I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.,No
19419,"I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.",No
19421,"Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.",No
19422,"You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.",No
19423,"I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.",No
19424,But it seems to me the record is clear.,No
19425,"The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.",Yes
19427,You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.,Yes
19428,But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.,Yes
19430,"I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.",No
19431,"And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.",No
19432,This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.,No
19433,And we have a responsibility.,No
19434,You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.,Yes
19435,Is that the kind of leadership we need?,No
19436,And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.,No
19437,"But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.",No
19439,"Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.",Yes
19440,That's what I thought we ought to do.,No
19441,"Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.",Yes
19442,And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.,Yes
19443,I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.,No
19444,We just have a different approach.,No
19445,"But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.",No
19446,"I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.",No
19447,We need to do this together and we can.,No
19450,Not if I didn't have a better idea.,No
19451,But I've got a better idea.,No
19452,It's something I've worked on for 15 years.,No
19453,It's called the automated check or the instant check.,No
19454,It's being used in 17 states right now.,Yes
19455,"States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.",No
19456,You don't buy any gun.,No
19457,You don't get any gun.,No
19458,"We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.",Yes
19459,We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.,No
19460,"And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.",No
19461,"I've been working on this for a long, long time.",No
19462,"You walk in, you put your little card in there.",No
19463,"If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.",No
19464,"You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.",No
19465,"If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.",No
19466,The administration says they support the instant check.,Yes
19467,"They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.",Yes
19468,"In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.",No
19469,This keeps up with technology.,No
19470,It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.,Yes
19471,That is the bottom line.,No
19472,"And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.",No
19473,And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.,No
19474,You talk about the Brady Bill.,No
19475,There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.,Yes
19476,"And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.",Yes
19477,Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.,No
19479,"Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.",Yes
19480,"And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.",No
19481,But let's look at the facts here.,No
19482,"The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.",Yes
19483,Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.,Yes
19484,He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.,Yes
19485,He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.,Yes
19486,"Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.",Yes
19487,But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.,Yes
19489,We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.,Yes
19490,And this is a safer country.,No
19491,"So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.",No
19492,"Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.",No
19493,"I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.",No
19495,I told the NRA that's history.,No
19496,You're not going to worry about it anymore.,No
19497,I'm not going to worry about it anymore.,No
19499,"Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.",No
19500,Talking about this and this.,No
19501,"You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.",No
19502,It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.,Yes
19503,"So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.",No
19506,"If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.",No
19507,Look at where we are today.,No
19508,The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.,No
19509,"I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.",No
19510,"We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.",Yes
19511,The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.,No
19512,The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.,Yes
19513,"And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.",Yes
19514,There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.,Yes
19515,We have worked hard for peace and freedom.,No
19516,"When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.",No
19517,"When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.",Yes
19518,Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.,Yes
19520,We just had the election there.,No
19521,"We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.",Yes
19522,We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.,No
19523,"The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",Yes
19525,"Well, I have a different view.",No
19526,"Again, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.",Yes
19527,Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.,Yes
19528,"But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.",Yes
19529,"They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.",Yes
19530,They asked for the tanks.,Yes
19531,They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.,Yes
19533,We turn it over to the United Nations.,Yes
19534,The President didn't have much to do about it.,No
19535,"You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.",Yes
19536,"You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.",Yes
19537,So we need more protection from America.,No
19539,There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.,Yes
19540,I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.,No
19541,"We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.",Yes
19543,"We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.",No
19544,"Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.",Yes
19546,"First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.",No
19547,"I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.",Yes
19548,"Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.",Yes
19549,"Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.",Yes
19550,And institutions are beginning to function.,No
19551,"In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.",Yes
19552,There will always be problems in this whole world.,No
19553,"But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.",No
19555,"Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.",Yes
19556,Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.,No
19557,Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.,No
19558,"We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.",No
19559,"And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.",No
19561,He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.,Yes
19562,It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.,Yes
19564,"And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.",No
19565,He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.,No
19566,That would be my position.,No
19567,"Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.",No
19568,We all fight over how much money is there.,No
19569,"I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.",No
19570,"You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.",Yes
19571,Devastated states like California and others.,No
19572,And I think now we've got a problem.,No
19573,We've got to go back and look.,No
19574,"It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.",No
19575,"You may have said that, too.",No
19576,"But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.",No
19577,"We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.",No
19578,Our military is the strongest military in the world.,No
19579,"It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.",No
19580,There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.,Yes
19581,We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.,No
19582,"I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.",Yes
19583,That is my solemn obligation.,No
19584,You ask when do you decide to deploy them.,No
19585,The interests of the American people must be at stake.,No
19586,Our values must be at stake.,No
19587,We have to be able to make a difference.,No
19588,And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.,No
19589,"But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.",Yes
19590,When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.,No
19591,When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.,No
19592,"I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.",No
19594,"Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.",No
19595,You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.,Yes
19596,"We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.",No
19597,"They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.",Yes
19599,We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.,No
19601,We don't have any inspection.,No
19602,"We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.",No
19603,Someone called them something else.,No
19605,We don't know what's going to happen.,No
19606,"Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.",Yes
19607,"And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.",No
19608,"The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.",No
19610,"Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.",No
19611,"In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.",Yes
19612,"We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.",Yes
19613,Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.,Yes
19614,"They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.",No
19616,"I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.",Yes
19617,And the United States needs help from other countries.,No
19618,Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.,No
19619,But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.,No
19620,"Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.",Yes
19621,"And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.",No
19622,That's the point I made.,No
19623,We have to be firm and strong.,No
19624,And I hope that will happen.,No
19625,It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.,No
19626,We have not been firm and strong.,No
19627,You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.,No
19628,It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.,Yes
19629,"In my view, the policy has failed.",No
19630,"So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.",No
19631,"But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.",No
19632,"A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.",Yes
19633,And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.,No
19634,When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.,Yes
19635,"When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.",Yes
19636,This is a serious business.,No
19637,"It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.",No
19638,There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.,No
19639,"Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.",Yes
19640,His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.,Yes
19642,So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.,No
19645,Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.,No
19646,"We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.",No
19647,"I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.",No
19649,"Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.",No
19650,The President was opposed to it in 1993.,Yes
19651,"He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.",Yes
19652,Most people want to see their own doctor.,No
19653,They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.,No
19655,"So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.",Yes
19656,"We've been for that for four, five, six years.",No
19657,The President held it up.,Yes
19658,"And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.",Yes
19659,But it will cover preexisting conditions.,Yes
19660,"If you change your job, you're going to be covered.",Yes
19661,"So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.",No
19662,But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.,No
19663,"Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.",Yes
19664,It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.,No
19665,"Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.",No
19666,"Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.",Yes
19667,And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.,No
19668,"Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.",No
19669,The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.,Yes
19670,I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.,Yes
19671,"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.",Yes
19672,"You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.",No
19673,"I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.",No
19674,"There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.",No
19675,Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.,No
19676,"In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.",No
19682,"Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.",No
19683,"Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.",Yes
19684,"Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.",Yes
19685,"What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.",Yes
19686,We did not feel that I could commit.,No
19687,"I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.",No
19688,So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.,No
19689,We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.,Yes
19690,Was it the right thing to do?,No
19693,Did it make him withdraw from the north?,No
19694,"Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.",No
19695,We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.,No
19696,"We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.",No
19698,"Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.",Yes
19699,I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.,No
19700,"And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.",Yes
19701,Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.,Yes
19702,"We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.",Yes
19705,Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.,No
19706,"We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.",Yes
19707,Did we inflict any damage?,No
19709,Did we have any allies helping?,No
19710,"Well, we have Great Britain.",No
19711,"They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.",No
19713,"Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.",No
19714,We had to get their permission.,No
19715,"The bottom line is, we went in there alone.",Yes
19716,We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.,No
19717,We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.,Yes
19718,Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.,No
19720,Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.,No
19721,Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.,No
19722,"I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.",No
19723,It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.,No
19725,I still believe it was the right thing to do.,No
19731,"Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?",No
19733,I want to be very serious.,No
19734,I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.,Yes
19735,I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.,Yes
19736,So it's not that we always disagree.,No
19738,The Mideast is very difficult.,No
19739,"But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.",No
19740,Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.,No
19741,Maybe that was the purpose.,No
19742,And I know talks have started again today.,No
19743,But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.,No
19744,"It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.",No
19745,"Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.",No
19746,"I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.",No
19747,We've lost credibility around the world.,No
19748,"Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.",No
19749,"Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.",No
19750,But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.,No
19751,"And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.",Yes
19752,We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.,Yes
19753,It is a very difficult environment.,No
19754,The feelings are very strong.,No
19755,There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.,Yes
19756,Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.,No
19757,"I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.",Yes
19758,"And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.",No
19759,"I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.",No
19760,Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.,Yes
19763,The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.,Yes
19764,It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.,No
19765,The killing and tragedies had taken place.,Yes
19766,"And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it.",No
19767,It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.,No
19768,And I don't intend to politicize it.,No
19769,I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.,No
19773,"Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.",No
19774,And I think I know what he meant by that.,No
19775,"He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.",No
19776,"But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.",No
19777,That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.,No
19778,"And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.",Yes
19779,That's why we're moving in the right direction.,No
19780,And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.,No
19781,That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.,No
19782,"That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.",No
19783,"That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.",No
19785,I am very oriented toward the future.,No
19786,I think this election has to be geared toward the future.,No
19787,"I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.",No
19789,"You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.",No
19790,But Kenny was a great talker.,No
19791,And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.,No
19792,"So we always had a rule, we divided by six.",No
19793,Maybe in your case maybe just two.,No
19794,"But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.",No
19795,"So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.",No
19796,"He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.",No
19797,"When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.",No
19798,I also want a bridge to the truth.,No
19799,We have to tell the truth.,No
19800,We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.,No
19801,"And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.",No
19802,"We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.",No
19804,I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.,No
19805,"But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.",No
19806,I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.,No
19807,"But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.",No
19808,"Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.",Yes
19809,"If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.",No
19810,"I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.",No
19813,"I didn't favor it when it was in, started.",No
19815,"It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.",Yes
19816,So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.,No
19817,"Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.",No
19818,I've reached out to people all my life.,No
19819,"I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.",No
19820,"And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.",No
19821,I'm not some extremist out here.,No
19823,I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.,Yes
19826,And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.,No
19827,"So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.",No
19828,I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.,No
19829,"I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.",No
19830,But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.,No
19831,Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.,No
19833,"It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.",No
19834,"Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.",No
19835,We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.,No
19836,"There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.",Yes
19837,The ones that are out there are doing well.,No
19838,What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.,Yes
19839,"If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.",No
19840,But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.,Yes
19841,"He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.",Yes
19842,"He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.",Yes
19844,90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.,Yes
19845,I'd better correct the President.,No
19846,"I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.",No
19847,"I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.",Yes
19848,I've supported all the education programs.,Yes
19849,"I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.",No
19850,"So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.",No
19851,Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.,No
19852,"Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.",No
19856,"I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.",Yes
19857,"But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.",No
19858,"I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.",Yes
19859,"Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.",No
19860,I have been a strong force for reform.,No
19861,"And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.",Yes
19862,I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.,No
19863,I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.,No
19864,"And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.",Yes
19865,It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.,Yes
19868,That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.,Yes
19869,"We need to be doing more in education, not less.",No
19870,"Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.",No
19871,"It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.",Yes
19872,"We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.",Yes
19873,"And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.",Yes
19876,I'm a product of a public school.,Yes
19877,You attended a private school for some time in your life.,No
19879,"You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.",No
19880,"When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.",Yes
19881,"And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.",No
19882,You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.,No
19883,"Now that's not reform, Mr. President.",No
19884,Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.,No
19886,Some schools aren't even safe.,Yes
19888,"Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.",No
19889,"If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.",No
19890,"First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.",No
19891,"I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.",No
19892,"And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.",Yes
19893,"You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.",No
19894,"Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.",No
19895,"If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.",No
19896,I might say the results are highly ambiguous.,No
19897,But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.,Yes
19898,"It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.",No
19901,"I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.",No
19902,And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.,No
19903,"Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.",No
19904,I feel strongly about education.,No
19905,"I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.",No
19906,We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.,No
19907,"Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.",No
19908,"It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.",No
19909,"It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.",No
19910,But this is a very liberal administration.,No
19911,This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.,Yes
19912,This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.,Yes
19913,This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.,Yes
19914,"This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.",Yes
19915,I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.,No
19916,There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.,No
19917,There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.,No
19918,"When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.",No
19919,"And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.",No
19920,"It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.",No
19921,It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.,No
19922,And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.,No
19923,The American people should make up their own mind.,No
19925,We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.,Yes
19926,We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.,Yes
19927,"We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.",Yes
19928,The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.,No
19929,"Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.",No
19930,"Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.",No
19931,"You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.",No
19932,Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.,No
19933,"The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.",Yes
19934,And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.,No
19935,I remember talking by the telephone.,No
19936,I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.,No
19937,"I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.",No
19938,"In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.",Yes
19939,"And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.",No
19941,"I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.",No
19942,I don't believe in discrimination.,No
19943,I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.,No
19944,"I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.",No
19945,"It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.",Yes
19946,"And I did stop them, I admit that.",No
19947,I sure stopped their budget.,Yes
19948,Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.,Yes
19949,"It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.",Yes
19950,It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.,Yes
19951,Their budget weakened our support for education.,No
19952,"$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.",Yes
19953,"Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.",Yes
19954,It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.,No
19955,It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.,No
19956,"Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.",No
19957,"Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.",No
19958,"George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.",No
19959,"I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.",No
19960,Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.,No
19961,And so I think you take a look at it.,No
19962,"The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.",No
19963,They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.,No
19964,Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?,No
19965,"Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?",No
19966,That's why we want an economic package.,No
19967,We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.,No
19968,That's what our message is to the people watching.,No
19969,"Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.",No
19970,"The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.",No
19971,"And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.",No
19974,"Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.",No
19975,"I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.",No
19976,"So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.",No
19977,The people want economic reform.,No
19978,They're having a hard time making ends meet.,No
19979,"You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.",No
19981,This is about getting the economy moving again.,No
19982,This is about American jobs and opportunities.,No
19983,"It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.",No
19984,When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.,No
19985,I think the government can do better.,No
19988,"Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.",No
19989,So I think he's a bit taller than I am.,No
19990,But I think there are personal differences.,No
19991,"I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.",No
19992,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.",No
19993,It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.,No
19994,And not about personal things.,No
19995,"You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.",No
19996,I know he wants to disown it.,No
19997,"I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.",Yes
19998,"The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.",Yes
20000,"Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.",Yes
20001,"But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.",No
20002,"I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.",No
20003,"Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.",No
20005,Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.,No
20006,Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.,No
20007,"Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.",Yes
20008,"Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.",Yes
20009,It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.,No
20010,"Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.",No
20011,"Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.",No
20012,"You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.",Yes
20013,"It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.",Yes
20014,"Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.",No
20015,"I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.",No
20016,"And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.",No
20017,I'm not discussing Whitewater now.,No
20018,But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.,No

20028,This is something I take seriously and that's my position.,No
20029,But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.,No
20030,Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.,No
20031,"I mean, you may be sending a signal.",No
20032,"I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.",No
20033,"But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.",No
20034,And I think he made a mistake.,No
20035,"And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.",No
20036,But apparently his position hasn't changed.,No
20037,"If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.",No
20039,"And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.",No
20040,And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.,No
20042,"I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.",No
20043,"You know, so one of your liberal friends.",No
20050,"See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.",No
20051,"I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.",No

20055,But I respect the presidency.,No
20056,I've served under a number of presidents.,No
20057,They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.,No
20058,So I'd rather talk about my strengths.,No
20059,And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.,No
20060,"It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.",No
20061,You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.,No

20068,"If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.",No
20069,"People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.",No
20070,That's what this race is all about.,No
20071,I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.,No
20072,And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.,No
20073,But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.,No
20074,"A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.",No
20075,A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.,No
20076,"Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.",No
20077,A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.,No
20078,A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.,No
20079,That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.,No
20080,And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.,No
20081,"The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.",No

20091,He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.,No
20092,But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.,No
20093,I wasn't just getting more power and more power.,No

20103,"We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.",Yes
20104,"I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.",Yes
20105,"I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.",Yes

20111,"We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.",Yes
20112,But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.,No

20124,"The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.",Yes

20131,I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.,No

20145,I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.,No
20146,And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.,No
20147,And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.,No
20148,I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.,No
20149,The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.,Yes
20150,All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.,No
20151,And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.,No
20152,I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.,No
20153,I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.,No
20154,"Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.",No

20157,"I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.",No
20158,They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.,No
20159,"You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.",No
20160,"And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.",No
20161,"It's important, it's their future.",No
20162,And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.,Yes
20163,"And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.",No
20164,And I know that I'm someone older than you.,No
20165,But I've had my anxious moments in my life.,No
20166,I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.,No
20167,I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.,No

20199,"Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate.",No
20200,"I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family.",No
20201,I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.,No
20202,I have questioned his proposals.,No
20204,I think this is a very important moment for our country.,No
20205,We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.,No
20206,"And in this election, America has to make an important choice.",No
20207,"Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?",No
20208,I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.,No

20211,I will pay down the national debt.,No
20212,I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.,No
20213,And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.,No
20214,I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.,No
20215,"If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people.",No
20216,"If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.",No
20217,By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution.,No
20218,I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.,No
20219,"And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.",No
20220,That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.,No
20222,"Well, we do come from different places.",No
20223,I come from West Texas.,No
20224,The governor is the chief executive officer.,No
20225,We know how to set agendas.,No
20226,I think you'll find the difference reflected in our budgets.,No
20227,I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.,No
20228,"One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.",No
20229,I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.,No
20230,"And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.",Yes
20231,His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.,Yes
20232,"It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.",Yes
20234,Tonight youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.,No
20237,"I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.",No
20238,And let me give you an example of what I mean.,No
20239,"Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.",Yes
20240,"Now, I think those are the wrong priorities.",No
20241,"Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts.",No
20242,"And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.",No
20243,I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.,No
20244,And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.,No
20245,Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.,Yes
20246,I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we've moved millions of people in America into good jobs.,Yes
20247,"But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.",No
20249,Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.,No
20250,People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.,Yes
20251,And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?,No
20252,Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.,Yes
20253,There is a difference of opinion.,No
20254,My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.,No
20255,That's not what I think.,No
20256,I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.,No
20257,It's a difference of opinion.,No
20258,It's a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.,Yes
20262,I take him for his word.,No
20263,"Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.",No
20265,"And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.",No
20266,And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.,No
20267,"I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.",Yes
20268,"Somebody that can come to Washington and say let's forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.",No
20269,"Jim, if I could just respond.",No
20271,"The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.",Yes
20272,"He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.",Yes
20273,"I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.",No
20274,"That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.",Yes
20277,I hope itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about wealthy people.,No
20282,"Actually what I've said, Jim.",No
20283,I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.,No
20284,And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors.,Yes
20285,And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.,Yes
20286,It seems like they can't get it done.,No
20287,"Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.",No
20288,And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.,No
20290,They've had a chance to form consensus.,No
20291,"I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.",Yes
20292,"But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program.",No
20293,But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.,No
20294,"They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors.",No
20295,"And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all.",No
20296,That's what I've been critical about the administration for.,No
20298,I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.,No
20299,"Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow.",Yes
20300,"There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.",No
20302,"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare.",Yes
20303,The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.,Yes
20304,"It's not, and let me explain the difference.",No
20305,"Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor.",Yes
20306,Your doctor chooses your prescription.,No
20307,No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you.,No
20308,Then you go to your own pharmacy.,No
20309,You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.,Yes
20310,"If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.",Yes
20311,Now here is the contrast.,No
20312,95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years.,Yes
20313,"Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?",Yes
20314,I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.,No
20315,Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.,No
20316,It's just not the way I think and it's not my intentions and not my plan.,No
20317,I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.,No
20318,We need to reform Medicare.,No
20319,ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.,No
20320,"And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.",No
20321,"The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.",No
20322,If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.,No
20323,But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.,Yes
20324,"No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.",No
20325,"We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision.",No
20326,I believe we ought to give seniors more options.,No
20327,I believe we ought to make the system work better.,No
20329,"I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.",No
20330,"You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.",No
20331,"My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.",Yes
20332,"My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.",No
20333,It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.,No
20334,If I could respond to that.,No
20335,Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.,No
20336,The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.,Yes
20337,I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox.,No
20338,I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.,Yes
20339,Now here is the difference.,No
20340,Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.,No
20341,"Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.",Yes
20342,Let me give you one quick example.,No
20343,There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.,No
20344,"He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.",No
20345,"They have an income of $25,000 a year.",No
20346,They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.,No
20347,"Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.",No
20348,"Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.",Yes
20349,"I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.",No
20350,Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.,No
20351,It's called Immediate Helping Hand.,No
20352,"Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.",No
20355,Can I make another point?,No
20356,"They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.",Yes
20357,"Look, this is a man who has great numbers.",No
20359,"I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.",No
20361,It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.,No
20362,"Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.",Yes
20363,The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.,No
20364,But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.,Yes
20365,Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.,Yes
20366,"If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.",Yes
20367,It's from $4000 to about $2000.,Yes
20368,"Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.",Yes
20376,It's just clear you can go to the website and look.,No
20377,"If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.",Yes
20378,And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.,Yes
20383,The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.,No
20384,That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.,No
20385,Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.,No
20386,They have had their chance to get something done.,No
20387,I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.,No
20388,"All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.",No
20389,Let me call your attention to the key word there.,No
20390,He said all poor seniors.,No
20392,All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.,Yes
20394,"If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.",No
20395,Yours is phased in in eight years.,No
20397,For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.,Yes
20398,Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.,Yes
20405,And here is the simple difference.,No
20406,"My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.",Yes
20407,"And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.",No
20408,"Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.",Yes
20409,"And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.",No
20410,And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.,No
20411,"And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.",No
20412,"Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.",No
20413,There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.,No
20414,"Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.",Yes
20415,I think that is the wrong choice.,No
20416,It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.,No
20417,I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.,No
20418,"We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.",No
20419,It's an issue I know a lot about.,No
20420,I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.,No
20421,This is an administration that's had no plan.,No
20422,And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.,No
20423,"First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.",No
20424,"Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.",No
20425,The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.,No
20426,You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.,No
20427,When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.,No
20428,Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.,Yes
20429,"I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.",No
20430,I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.,No
20431,I want to develop the coal resources in America.,No
20433,"WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.",Yes
20437,I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.,No
20438,"Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.",No
20439,I commend you for supporting that.,No
20440,I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.,Yes
20441,And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.,No
20442,"Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.",No
20443,"The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.",No
20444,They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.,Yes
20445,"I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.",No
20447,Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.,No
20448,Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.,No
20449,And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.,Yes
20450,There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.,Yes
20451,There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.,No
20452,Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?,No
20453,I'm against removing dams in the northwest.,No
20454,I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where the vice president stands but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a renewable energy source of energy.,No
20455,We need to keep that in line.,No
20457,There is an abundant supply of coal in America.,No
20458,I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.,No
20459,I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.,No
20460,My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.,No
20461,We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.,No
20462,"We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.",No
20463,"I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.",No
20464,I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.,Yes
20465,This is a major problem facing America.,No
20466,The administration did not deal with it.,Yes
20467,It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.,No
20468,"If I may just briefly, Jim, note.",No
20469,I found a couple of other things we agree upon.,No
20470,"We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.",No
20471,I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.,No
20472,I made a proposal three months ago on this.,No
20473,"And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.",No
20474,We don't have to do that.,No
20476,"I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.",No
20478,It's the right thing for the consumers.,No
20479,Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.,Yes
20480,And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.,No
20481,Well can I have the last word on this?,No
20485,I don't think a president can do that.,No
20486,"I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.",No
20487,"This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.",Yes
20488,I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.,No
20489,Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.,No
20491,"As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.",No
20492,I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.,No
20493,"What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification.",No
20494,I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.,No
20495,This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.,No
20496,I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.,No
20497,This is an issue that will require a new attitude.,No
20498,We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.,Yes
20499,Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.,No
20500,Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.,No
20501,Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.,No
20502,Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.,No
20503,"As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.",No
20504,I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.,No
20506,"Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.",Yes
20507,They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.,Yes
20508,This is indeed a very important issue.,No
20509,"First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.",No
20510,That's not the main issue.,No
20511,The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.,No
20512,I support a woman's right to choose.,No
20514,It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.,No
20515,"And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.",Yes
20517,He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.,No
20518,"I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.",Yes
20519,And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.,No
20522,I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.,No
20523,The FDA has made its decision.,Yes
20525,"I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.",No
20526,"Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.",No
20527,"And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.",Yes
20528,Now that sounds to me a little bit different.,No
20529,I just think that we ought to support the decision.,No
20530,I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.,Yes
20535,The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.,No
20536,Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.,No
20537,People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.,No
20538,That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.,No
20539,I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.,No
20540,That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.,No
20541,They shouldn't misuse their bench.,No
20542,I don't believe in liberal activist judges.,No
20543,I believe in strict constructionists.,No
20544,Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.,No
20545,"I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.",No
20546,"They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.",No
20548,We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.,No
20549,"I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.",No
20550,"And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.",No
20551,"And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.",No
20552,"And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.",Yes
20553,It's very clear to me.,No
20554,I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.,No
20557,It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.,No
20558,I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.,No
20559,I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.,No
20560,That's what a governor gets to do.,No
20561,A governor gets to name supreme court judges.,No
20562,He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.,No
20563,I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.,No
20566,It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.,No
20567,I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.,No
20568,"If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.",No
20569,"A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.",No
20570,Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.,No
20571,"It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.",No
20572,I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.,No
20573,"He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.",No
20577,"Well, Milosevic has lost the election.",No
20578,"His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.",Yes
20580,Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.,Yes
20581,There's now a general strike going on.,No
20583,"I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.",No
20584,The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.,No
20585,Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.,Yes
20586,"Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.",Yes
20587,That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.,No
20588,"Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.",Yes
20589,"Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.",No
20590,So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.,No
20591,"But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.",No
20592,And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.,No
20594,"Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.",No
20595,As the vice president is.,No
20596,It's time for the man to go.,No
20597,It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.,No
20598,That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.,No
20599,But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.,No
20600,Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.,No
20601,The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.,No
20602,We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.,No
20604,It's time for the man to leave.,No
20608,"In this particular situation, no.",No
20609,Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.,Yes
20610,And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.,No
20611,"Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.",No
20612,"But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.",No
20613,They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.,No
20614,I think that's the wrong thing.,No
20615,"I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.",No
20616,But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.,No
20617,"Well obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.",No
20619,"Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.",No
20624,It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.,No
20625,I would use pressure and diplomacy.,No
20626,There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.,Yes
20627,It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.,No
20630,"Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened.",No
20631,That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.,No
20632,"Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.",No
20633,Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.,No
20634,"Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.",No
20635,Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.,No
20636,"And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.",No
20637,I would take the use of force very seriously.,No
20638,I would be guarded in my approach.,No
20639,I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.,No
20640,I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.,No
20641,The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.,No
20642,He believes in nation building.,No
20643,I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.,No
20644,I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,No
20645,So I would take my responsibility seriously.,No
20646,And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.,No
20647,Morale in today's military is too low.,No
20648,We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.,No
20649,"We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.",Yes
20650,Some of our troops are not well-equipped.,No
20651,I believe we're overextended in too many places.,No
20652,And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.,No
20653,It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.,Yes
20654,A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law.,No
20655,It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.,No
20656,Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.,No
20657,The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,No
20659,Let me tell you what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do.,No
20660,"First of all Ã‚ I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.",No
20661,"Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.",No
20662,"If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.",No
20663,"In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.",Yes
20664,"Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.",No
20665,"But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.",No
20666,"Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.",No
20667,I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.,No
20668,"I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.",No
20669,"I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.",Yes
20670,The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?,No

20997,But it's not good enough.,No
20998,My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.,No
20999,We need to do more and better.,No
21001,"No, there's no difference on that.",No
21002,"There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.",No
21003,I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.,No
21004,I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.,No
21005,"In terms of in response to the question, no.",No
21006,Can I comment on that?,No
21008,"You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have.",No
21009,"It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.",No
21010,"But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.",No
21011,And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.,No
21012,The difference is we've got a new policy.,Yes
21013,"And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.",No
21014,We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.,Yes
21015,We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.,Yes

21018,Too many people have been left behind.,No
21019,We have got to do much more.,No
21020,"The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.",No
21021,"And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.",No
21022,"I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.",Yes
21023,"I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.",No
21025,"One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.",Yes
21026,"I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts.""",No
21028,Now he's having to say that again.,No
21029,They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.,No
21030,"Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.",No
21031,The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.,Yes
21032,It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.,Yes
21033,That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.,No
21034,"This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.",Yes
21035,"His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.",No
21036,"We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",No
21037,"If I could respond, Jim.",No
21038,"What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.",Yes
21039,"Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.",Yes
21040,In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.,No
21041,"It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.",Yes
21042,"Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.",No
21043,But that's not the question.,No
21044,"The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?",No
21045,"And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.",Yes
21046,I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.,No
21047,It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.,Yes
21048,It will go to everybody who pays taxes.,No
21049,I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.,No
21050,I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.,No
21051,What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.,No
21061,"Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.",No
21063,I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.,No
21064,And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.,No
21065,That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.,Yes
21066,"Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.",No
21067,Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.,No
21068,And you talk about cutting benefits.,No
21069,I don't go along with it.,No
21070,I am opposed to it.,No
21071,I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.,Yes
21072,Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.,Yes
21073,"The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.",Yes
21074,"His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.",Yes
21075,It would borrow up to $3 trillion.,Yes
21076,"Now, Social Security has never done that.",Yes
21077,And I don't think it should do that.,No
21078,"I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.",No
21079,I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.,Yes
21080,"I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.",Yes
21081,He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.,No
21082,The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.,Yes
21083,"For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.",No
21084,A promise made will be a promise kept.,No
21085,You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.,No
21086,That's the difference of opinion.,No
21087,The vice president thinks it's the government's money.,No
21088,The payroll taxes are your money.,No
21089,"You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.",No
21090,The money stays within the Social Security system.,No
21091,It's a part of the Social Security system.,Yes
21092,He claims it will be out of Social Security.,Yes
21093,"It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.",No
21094,It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.,No
21095,I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.,No
21096,That you can pass on from one generation to the next.,No
21097,I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.,No
21098,"Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.",No
21099,There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.,Yes
21100,If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.,No
21102,"I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.",Yes
21103,My plan is Social Security plus.,No
21104,The governor's plan is Social Security minus.,No
21105,Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.,Yes
21106,"If you make bad investments, that's too bad.",No
21107,But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.,No
21109,And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year.,Yes
21110,"If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.",No
21111,"I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?",No
21113,There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.,Yes
21114,The trillion comes from the surplus.,Yes
21115,Surplus is money -- more money than needed.,No
21116,Let me tell you what your plan is.,No
21117,"It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.",No
21118,That is what it is.,No
21119,You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.,No
21120,It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.,No
21121,"It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets.",No
21122,The safest of federal investments yields 4%.,Yes
21123,That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.,Yes
21124,"It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks.",No
21125,Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you.,No
21126,"And you know what, the issue is changing.",No
21127,"Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do.",No
21128,"Could I respond to that, Jim?",No
21129,This is a big issue.,No
21130,Could we do another round on it?,No
21133,"When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States.",Yes
21134,"If you don't have trust in that, I do.",No
21135,"If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.",Yes
21136,This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory.,No
21138,This is a government that says younger workers can't possibly have their own assets.,No
21139,We need to think differently about the issue.,No
21140,We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.,No
21141,"If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.",No
21142,What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.,No
21145,The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.,No
21147,"The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.",No
21148,"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority.""",No
21149,I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.,No
21150,"I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here"" from the Oval Office desk to ""The buck stops here"" on the Lincoln bedroom.",No
21151,It's not good for the country and it's not right.,No
21152,We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office.,No
21154,"I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.",No
21155,And we can do better than the past administration has done.,No
21156,It's time for a fresh start.,No
21157,It's time for a new look.,No
21158,It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.,No
21159,"And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.",No
21160,"You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.",No

21185,"I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals.",No
21186,"And incidentally, one of them is this.",No
21187,This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party.,Yes
21188,"And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.",No
21189,"And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient's bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.",Yes

21318,I finally got 'em for 12 to 15 years.,No
21319,"And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?",No
21320,"And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.",Yes
21321,We got to cut it out.,No
21324,"Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.",Yes
21325,"And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.",Yes
21326,"And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.",Yes
21327,"That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.",No
21328,"But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.",No
21329,And the way to do that is to increase our exports.,No
21331,"I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us.",No
21332,"So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.",No
21333,I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.,No
21334,I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.,No
21335,"And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.",No
21336,"And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.",No
21338,"I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.",Yes
21339,The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.,No
21340,"It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.",Yes
21341,So what is the answer?,No
21342,Let me just mention three things very quickly.,No
21343,"Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.",No
21344,"Number two, change the tax code.",No
21345,There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.,Yes
21346,Our competitors don't do that.,No
21347,"Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.",No
21348,"Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.",No
21349,So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.,No
21358,And I'll tell you exactly why.,No
21359,Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.,Yes
21360,I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.,No
21361,I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.,No
21362,"Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.",No
21363,"Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.",Yes
21364,"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.",No
21365,"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.",Yes
21366,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.,No
21367,"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.",No
21368,"Let me also say, we're having an election today.",No
21369,You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.,No
21371,"Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.",No
21372,"You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.",No
21373,I think they're taxed too much.,No
21374,I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.,Yes
21375,I said that wasn't the right thing to do.,Yes
21376,"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.",Yes
21377,I don't believe that's the way to do it.,No
21378,Here's some thing that'll help.,No
21379,Give us a balanced budget amendment.,No
21380,"He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.",Yes
21382,I'd like the government to have that.,No
21383,"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.",No
21384,"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.",Yes
21386,Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.,No
21389,It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.,No
21390,"You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.",Yes
21391,"And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.",No
21392,You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.,No
21393,"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.",No
21394,"So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.",No
21395,That's the main growing thing in the budget.,No
21396,"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.",No
21397,"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.",No
21398,I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.,No
21400,"Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.",Yes
21401,"We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.",Yes
21402,"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.",No
21403,"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.",No
21404,This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.,No
21405,The American people asked me to get into it.,No
21406,But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.,Yes
21407,"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.",No
21408,And what I'm looking for is who did it?,No
21409,"Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.",No
21410,"Now, the facts are we have to fix it.",No
21411,I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.,No
21412,"When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.",No
21413,Young people with high grades can't get a job.,Yes
21414,People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.,Yes
21415,"In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.",Yes
21416,Now that's up to 40%.,Yes
21417,And what's happened in the meantime?,No
21418,The dollar's gone through the floor.,No
21419,"Now, whose fault is that?",No
21422,"Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.",No
21423,And everybody says they take responsibility.,No
21424,Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.,No
21425,"Put it to you bluntly, American people.",No
21426,"If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.",No
21427,"WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deal with our problems, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve our problems.",No
21429,"We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.",No
21430,When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.,No
21431,Today it will take 12 generations.,No
21432,Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.,No
21442,"No, I don't have an answer for everything.",No
21443,"As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.",No
21444,"And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.",No
21445,"We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.",No
21446,So the point is --,No
21447,"Like Jerry Brown, the 800 number.",No
21448,"-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.",No
21449,"And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.",No
21450,"I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.",Yes
21454,"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.",No
21455,I think you have to look at it.,No
21456,I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.,No
21457,"In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.",Yes
21458,It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.,No
21459,And everything in there says what I am for.,No
21460,"Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.",No
21461,"My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I've been president for 4 years, so I feel I've been talking issues.",No
21462,"You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.",No
21463,But character is an important part of the equation.,No
21464,The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.,No
21465,You did -- suffered through that?,No
21466,"Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered.",No
21467,"But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.",No
21468,"I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth.",No
21469,"And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.",No
21470,That says something about character.,No
21471,"My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.",No
21472,Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me.,No
21473,But that's what I feel.,No
21474,That's what I feel passionately about.,No
21475,I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.,No
21476,How would he feel about it?,No
21479,But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.,No
21480,And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.,No
21481,You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --,No
21484,I don't want to --,No
21486,I don't want to --,No
21488,I get wound up because I feel strongly --,No
21491,Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.,No
21492,I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers.,No
21493,I also had a program starting last year.,Yes
21494,I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.,No
21495,Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.,No
21496,Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.,Yes
21497,"When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.",No
21498,He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.,Yes
21499,"So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.",No
21500,We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.,No
21501,"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times.",No
21502,"Now, I don't want to get into that --",No
21503,Please don't get into the Washington Post.,No
21505,Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.,No
21507,I'm not interested in his character.,No
21508,I want to change the character of the presidency.,No
21509,And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.,No
21510,So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.,No
21528,Let's talk about programs for children.,No
21534,I think it depends how you define it.,No
21535,"I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues.",No
21536,Let's talk about the programs.,No
21537,"But in the presidency, a lot goes into it.",No
21543,That's not specific in terms of a program.,No
21544,This is what a president has to do.,No
21545,"So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.",No
21547,Ross had his hand up.,No
21549,"Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.",No
21550,I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.,No
21551,So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.,No
21552,"Now, just for the record, I don't have any spin doctors.",No
21553,I don't have any speechwriters.,No
21555,I make those charts you see on television.,No
21556,But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.,No
21557,"See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?",No
21559,"I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.",No
21560,The ideas I express are mine.,No
21561,I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.,Yes
21562,So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.,No
21563,I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.,No
21564,I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.,No
21565,I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.,No
21570,And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.,Yes
21571,I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.,Yes
21572,I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.,Yes
21573,"I've got 5.5 million hard-working people who put me on the ballot, and I belong to them.",Yes
21574,And they're interested in what you're interested in.,No
21576,I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.,Yes
21577,I never got to say that.,No
21578,"There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money.",No
21579,I took the pledge we'd cut it out.,No
21588,I'll be glad to take a shot at it.,No
21590,"I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry.",No
21591,We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.,Yes
21592,That happened when I was president.,Yes
21593,"And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.",No
21594,"Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.",No
21595,But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.,No
21596,We hear all the negatives.,No
21597,When you're president you expect this.,No
21598,Everybody's running against the incumbent.,No
21601,But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.,No
21602,Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.,Yes
21603,"Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.",No
21605,And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.,No
21606,When we went out to south central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.,No
21608,I went to a boys' club.,No
21609,"And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.",No
21610,We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.,No
21611,But there's going to be a new Congress.,No
21613,There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.,Yes
21614,You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.,No
21615,"And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.",No
21616,Help me pass these programs.,No
21618,"Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.",No
21619,That's the problem with our system.,No
21620,If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.,No
21621,"You could knock out the tax increases and you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones.",No
21623,That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.,Yes
21624,"And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.",Yes
21625,This is not mud slinging.,No
21626,This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.,No
21627,"This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.",No
21628,But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.,Yes
21629,Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.,Yes
21631,"I mean, we agree with that.",No
21632,But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.,No
21633,"My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.",Yes
21634,And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.,No
21635,"There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.",Yes
21637,"They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.",No
21638,We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we're going to lose in defense -- if we target it.,No
21639,"But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.",Yes
21640,"It's making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.",No
21641,We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.,No
21644,First you've got to have money to pay for these things.,No
21645,So you've got to create jobs.,No
21646,There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.,No
21647,"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.",No
21648,I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.,No
21649,"But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.",No
21650,"Now, results is what counts.",No
21651,The president can't order Congress around.,No
21652,Congress can't order the president around.,Yes
21653,"That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?",No
21654,But you have to work together.,No
21655,"Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.",No
21657,"The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.",No
21658,"We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.",Yes
21659,That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.,No
21660,The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.,No
21661,These people are hurting in the inner cities.,No
21662,"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas.",No
21663,What are low paying jobs?,No
21664,"Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.",No
21665,They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.,No
21666,"Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.",No
21667,You just give me a job.,No
21668,Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.,No
21672,"If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.",No
21673,I've spent my life creating jobs.,Yes
21674,That's something I know how to do.,No
21675,"And, very simply, in the inner city, they're starved -- you see, small business is the way to jump start the inner city, not --",No
21677,You want jobs in the inner city?,No
21678,Do you want jobs in the inner city?,No
21682,"Well, I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.",No
21683,"And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.",No
21684,And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.,No
21685,That's the way I would do it.,No
21686,"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.",No
21694,I support the right to keep and bear arms.,No
21695,"I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.",No
21696,"But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.",No
21697,"Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.",Yes
21698,"Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.",No
21699,I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.,No
21700,We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.,No
21701,"The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street.",No
21702,"There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.",Yes
21703,"I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.",No
21705,"In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.",Yes
21706,In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.,Yes
21707,So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.,No
21710,I think you put your finger on a major problem.,No
21711,"I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.",No
21713,"I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.",Yes
21714,"I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.",No
21715,I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.,No
21716,"Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.",Yes
21717,I am not for national registration of firearms.,Yes
21718,Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.,Yes
21719,"I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.",No
21720,But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.,Yes
21721,"I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.",No
21722,We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.,Yes
21723,So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.,No
21725,"We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.",No
21726,"And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.",Yes
21727,We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.,No
21728,"The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.",Yes
21729,"So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.",No
21731,I didn't get to make a comment on this.,No
21733,"Oh, you're going to let me.",No
21737,"On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.",No
21738,"I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.",No
21739,"Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.",No
21740,So why pass a law that won't fix it?,No
21741,"Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.",No
21742,And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.,No
21744,We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.,No
21745,"This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.",No
21746,"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.",No
21747,"And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.",No
21748,"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.",No
21749,But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.,No
21755,I'll be glad to respond.,No
21757,I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.,No
21758,"I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.",No
21759,"The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.",No
21760,What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?,No
21761,Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.,No
21762,"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.",Yes
21763,We've got to do something about it.,No
21764,"And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.",No
21765,"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.",No
21766,And how to get them passed?,No
21767,Send us some people that will pass the idea.,No
21768,And I think you will.,No
21769,I think the American people want it now.,No
21770,"Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.",No
21771,"Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.",No
21774,"I know they're popular, but I'm against them.",No
21776,"I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.",No
21777,"Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.",No
21778,"I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.",No
21779,"Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.",No
21780,You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.,No
21781,"Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.",No
21782,"I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.",No
21783,"If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.",No
21784,"So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.",No
21787,Let me do first on a personal level.,No
21788,"If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.",No
21789,I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.,No
21790,"And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.",No
21791,"Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight.",No
21792,"If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.",No
21793,But we have got to reform government.,No
21794,"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.",No
21796,So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.,No
21797,"And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.",No
21798,"They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.",No
21799,"I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.",No
21804,"I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.",Yes
21805,So let me try to answer you in this way.,No
21806,Let's start with a premise.,No
21807,"We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.",Yes
21808,We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.,Yes
21809,A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.,Yes
21810,"So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.",No
21811,"Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.",Yes
21812,"So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.",No
21813,"Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.",No
21814,"Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.",No
21815,I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation.,No
21816,I think you have to take on medical fraud.,No
21817,I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.,No
21818,I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.,Yes
21819,I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.,No
21820,The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.,No
21821,"To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.",No
21822,"And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth.",No
21823,"Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.",No
21824,"They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.",Yes
21825,They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country.,Yes
21827,"It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency.",No
21831,I just have to say something.,No
21832,I don't want to stampede.,No
21833,Ross was very articulate across the country.,No
21834,I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.,No
21835,"Barbara's sitting over here and I -- but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done.",Yes
21836,"She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.",No
21838,One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.,No
21840,"It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.",Yes
21841,Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.,No
21842,"People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.",No
21843,So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.,No
21844,And my program is this.,No
21845,"Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.",No
21846,"A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.",No
21847,He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.,Yes
21848,"But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down.",Yes
21849,So I want to keep the quality of health care.,No
21850,That means keep government out of it.,No
21851,I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.,No
21852,It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.,No
21853,"I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.",No
21854,I think medical care should go with the person.,No
21855,"If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.",No
21856,"You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.",No
21857,I think it's a good program.,No
21858,"I'm really excited about getting it done, too.",No
21860,We have the most expensive health care system in the world.,Yes
21861,Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.,Yes
21862,"Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.",Yes
21863,Japan spends a little over 6% of its gross national product.,Yes
21866,You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.,No
21868,Go home and look in the mirror.,No
21869,"You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls.",No
21870,Wear your safety toe shoes when you go.,No
21871,"And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.",No
21872,The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.,No
21873,You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.,No
21874,"Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care.",No
21875,None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.,No
21876,A senator runs every 6 years.,No
21877,"He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.",Yes
21878,"Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?",No
21883,"Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again.",No
21884,You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.,No
21885,And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.,No
21886,The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.,No
21887,"I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.",No
21888,"Then you get what you want, and shouldn't you?",No
21890,"Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through.",No
21891,That's the way the game's played now.,No
21892,Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy.,No
21895,We have elections so people can make decisions about this.,No
21896,"The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it.",Yes
21897,They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care,Yes
21898,So I ask you to look at that.,No
21899,And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.,No
21900,That's what you have elections for.,No
21901,"If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.",No
21902,That's what the election was about.,No
21911,Who do you want to start with?,No
21913,It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.,No
21914,That's how much I care about it.,No
21915,"And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.",No
21916,But I have lived the American dream.,No
21917,I came from very modest background.,No
21918,"Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.",No
21919,That's true of any family.,No
21920,But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.,No
21921,"But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.",No
21922,"I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren.",No
21925,"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.",No
21927,Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --,No
21932,I love my grandchildren --,No
21934,I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.,No
21935,I think that that's an important part of being a parent.,No
21936,If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.,No
21937,Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?,No
21939,I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.,No
21946,"Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time.",No
21948,"It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.",No
21949,"And I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulties that families are having to make ends meet.",No
21951,"I mean, you've got to care.",No
21952,Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.,No
21953,"But I don't think it's fair to say, you haven't had cancer.",No
21955,"I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.",No
21956,But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.,No
21957,Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.,No
21959,"But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.",No
21960,"And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, vesting more, better education systems.",No
21962,I'm glad you clarified it.,No
21964,Tell me how it's affected you again.,No
21966,You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes?,No
21968,"Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.",No
21969,I'll tell you how it's affected me.,No
21970,Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.,Yes
21971,"I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.",Yes
21972,"I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.",No
21973,"When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.",No
21974,"When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.",No
21975,"And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.",No
21976,What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.,No
21977,It is because America has not invested in its people.,No
21978,It is because we have not grown.,No
21979,It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.,Yes
21980,We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.,Yes
21981,We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.,Yes
21982,Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.,Yes
21983,It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.,No
21984,"And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?",No
21985,"I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.",No
21999,"Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.",No
22000,"The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.",Yes
22001,So at least we have time to work with it.,No
22002,"But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.",No
22003,Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth.,No
22004,I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.,No
22005,All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions.,Yes
22006,And that is very important.,No
22007,"But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.",No
22008,It's still the most respected credit.,No
22009,"So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund.",No
22010,And I think that's the only answer.,No
22011,"But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.",No
22012,"One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.",No
22013,It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.,No
22014,And it's a big fight.,No
22015,And I don't want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.,No
22016,And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.,No
22017,You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.,No
22018,But that's what the election's about.,No
22019,I agree with the governor.,No
22020,That's what the election's about.,No
22021,"And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.",No
22024,"On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.",No
22025,You have a raging debate about those plans.,No
22026,"Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.",No
22027,"Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.",No
22028,"Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once.",No
22029,Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.,No
22030,"Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete.",Yes
22031,"Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you've put something into effect.",No
22032,The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.,Yes
22033,Everybody knows how to fix them.,No
22034,"There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.",No
22036,"See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.",Yes
22037,"Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.",No
22038,You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.,No
22039,Why did our government do it?,No
22040,To get the interest rates down.,No
22041,A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.,Yes
22042,"Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.",No
22043,"You know, and everybody's ducking it so I'm gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank.",No
22044,We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.,Yes
22045,We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is.,Yes
22046,"Now, that -- put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it's just kind of the way things are.",No
22047,"That's because it comes at you, not from you.",No
22048,"Now then, that money needs to be -- they don't even pay interest on it.",Yes
22049,They just write a note for the interest.,No
22051,Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?,No
22052,"I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.",No
22054,This is just 1 of 1000.,No
22055,"Now then, to nail it, there's one way out -- a growing, expanding job base.",No
22056,"A growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America.",No
22058,"If we're $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don't.",Yes
22059,"We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that's going to take a growing, expanding job base.",No
22060,That is priority one in this country.,No
22061,Put everybody that's breathing to work.,No
22062,"And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.",No
22073,I think I remember the question.,No
22075,"Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy.",No
22076,What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.,No
22077,"And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record.",No
22078,So I don't want you to read my lips and I sure don't want you to read his.,No
22079,I do hope you will read our plans.,No
22080,"Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.",No
22081,"There are different ideas -- the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas.",No
22082,"I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.",No
22083,You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.,No
22084,"Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.",Yes
22085,Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.,Yes
22086,"Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.",Yes
22087,What do we have to do?,No
22088,"By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.",No
22089,"Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.",No
22090,"What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee.",No
22091,"We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right?",No
22092,We had a guarantee -- and what happened?,No
22093,You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.,Yes
22094,So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.,No
22099,"Well, we have come to that position.",No
22100,"Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.",Yes
22102,New world order to me means freedom and democracy.,No
22103,"I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.",No
22104,"If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.",No
22105,"NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.",No
22106,"But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down.",No
22107,And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.,No
22108,I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.,No
22109,"And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.",No
22110,"You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.",No
22111,"I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others.",No
22112,Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.,Yes
22113,It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.,Yes
22114,We're doing this all around the world.,No
22115,"Yes, we got problems at home.",No
22116,And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.,No
22117,"But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.",No
22118,"President Reagan said no, peace through strength.",Yes
22120,"The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.",Yes
22121,"So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation.",No
22122,"And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security.",No
22123,"If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.",Yes
22124,And only the US could do this.,No
22128,"Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.",Yes
22129,"Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.",No
22130,All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.,Yes
22131,"I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.",No
22132,"We've got agreements, but they are still there.",No
22133,"With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.",Yes
22134,So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.,No
22135,We have to have money to do that.,No
22136,We have to have our people at work.,No
22137,"See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.",Yes
22138,I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.,No
22139,We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.,No
22140,We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.,Yes
22141,Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.,Yes
22142,If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.,No
22143,Coming out of World War II it made sense.,No
22144,"Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.",No
22145,I'll close on this point.,No
22146,You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.,No
22147,"If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.",No
22148,And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.,No
22152,I'd rather answer her question first and then I'll be glad to.,No
22153,Because the question you ask is important.,No
22154,The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.,No
22155,"Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing.",Yes
22156,And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.,No
22157,And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.,No
22158,We may differ about what the elements of that are.,No
22159,"I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.",No
22160,I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.,No
22161,Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.,No
22162,"Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower.",No
22163,We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.,Yes
22164,We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.,No
22165,"That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.",No
22166,"And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it's in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting.",No
22167,"We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.",No
22177,"I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.",No
22178,You can't do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that's why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about.,No
22179,"It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.",Yes
22181,"And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.",No
22183,We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.,No
22184,"And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.",No
22186,(Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this.,No
22187,"It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.",No
22188,And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.,Yes
22189,Democratic woman up there -- taking the lead in this.,No
22190,"The mayor up there, on the program.",No
22191,And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.,No
22192,So we've got to innovate through school choice.,No
22193,We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.,No
22194,But she is absolutely right.,No
22195,The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.,No
22196,The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.,No
22197,"But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things.",No
22198,We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.,No
22199,So this is what our program is all about.,No
22200,"And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.",No
22201,Federal funding for education is up substantially -- Pell grants are up.,Yes
22202,But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.,No
22204,"First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.",No
22205,"Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.",Yes
22206,"So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.",No
22207,But let me start with what you said.,No
22208,"I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.",No
22209,"We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.",Yes
22210,"Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.",No
22211,So what should we do?,No
22212,"Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics.",No
22213,"Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.",No
22214,"Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college.",No
22215,And community colleges are on the job.,No
22216,"Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.",No
22217,They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.,No
22218,"Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.",No
22219,"And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.",No
22220,I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.,No
22221,"But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.",No
22222,Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.,No
22227,"In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.",Yes
22228,So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget -- not very much.,Yes
22229,The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.,Yes
22230,The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.,Yes
22231,"And it's all covered in my budget from -- the plans that I've laid out -- from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget.",Yes
22232,It's all covered in the plan.,Yes
22235,"Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.",No
22236,"And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children.",No
22237,"You're going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you're spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody's getting it.",Yes
22238,And the children get lost in the process.,No
22240,"Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.",Yes
22241,One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.,No
22242,This is a government that is not serving you.,No
22243,"By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.",No
22244,"Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.",No
22245,"The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones -- you get the job, give your relatives a janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week.",No
22246,"Now, you're paying for that.",No
22247,Those schools belong to you.,No
22248,And we put up with that.,No
22249,"Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get.",No
22250,And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost.,Yes
22251,"If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that.",No
22252,"You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?",No
22253,"Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.",No
22254,There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.,No
22256,"You need small schools, not big schools.",No
22257,In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important.,No
22259,Everybody told me they were cost-effective.,No
22260,I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.,No
22261,5000 students -- why is a high school that big?,No
22263,Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.,No
22264,"Now, that has nothing to do with learning.",No
22265,"Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits -- in one place it was 35%.",Yes
22266,In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.,Yes
22267,"Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows.",No
22268,"Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.",No
22269,That's the only way we got him back.,No
22270,"(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.",No
22272,It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.,No
22273,"And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage.",No
22274,"At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.",No
22276,"You've got to have world class teachers, world class books.",No
22277,"If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day.",No
22278,I don't have time to tell you the stories.,No
22280,"Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.",No
22281,We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.,No
22282,"And here you've got, for the disadvantaged children, you've got to have early childhood development.",No
22283,Cheapest money you'll ever spend.,No
22284,First contact should be with the money when she's pregnant.,No
22285,"That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like your children were.",No
22286,They learn to think well or poorly of themselves in the first 18 months.,No
22289,And in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn.,No
22290,"And if they don't, they wind up in prison.",No
22292,And it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard.,Yes
22296,I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.,No
22297,"My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.",No
22298,It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.,No
22299,It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.,Yes
22300,"And where it's been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren't chosen find that they then compete and do better.",Yes
22301,So I think it's worth a shot.,No
22302,We've got a pilot program.,Yes
22303,It ought to be tried.,No
22304,"School choice -- public, private or religious.",No
22305,"Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.",Yes
22306,"Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.",No
22307,I just want to mention if I could --,No
22310,"Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.",No
22311,We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.,Yes
22312,It's the most successful thing we've ever done.,No
22313,Just a fact clarification real quickly.,No
22314,We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.,Yes
22315,There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.,Yes
22316,We spend more on education 'cause we spend so much more on colleges.,Yes
22317,"But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference.",Yes
22318,"There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.",No
22319,I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.,No
22320,I commend it to anybody.,No
22321,It's as good as any private school in the country.,No
22326,"Well, I don't have any idea but I hope it will happen some time in my lifetime.",No
22328,I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.,No
22329,"The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.",No
22330,More and more women are being elected.,Yes
22331,Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.,No
22332,"And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.",No
22333,"I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way.",No
22334,"This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.",No
22335,"I mean, women know what's it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work.",No
22336,They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.,No
22337,They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.,No
22338,So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.,No
22339,And I think it will happen in my lifetime.,No
22345,I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.,No
22347,"(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --",No
22349,You weren't impressed with the fact that he --,No
22352,"Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?",No
22361,I don't know -- starting after 4 years.,No
22363,"No, I think you'll see --",No
22365,I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.,No
22367,This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.,No
22368,Let's see how they do.,No
22369,I hope a lot of --,No
22371,I have a fearless forecast.,No
22372,A message just won't do it.,No
22373,Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?,No
22375,He wanted that said -- 4 years.,No
22377,"Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.",No
22378,These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.,No
22379,I'm sure there are hundreds of others.,No
22380,How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?,No
22389,I can think of many.,No
22394,How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?,No
22407,May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.,No
22408,(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!,No
22411,I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.,No
22414,"No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.",No
22415,three ways to do that.,No
22416,One is to raise taxes.,No
22417,One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.,No
22418,Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.,No
22419,I do not want to raise taxes.,No
22420,I differ with the 2 here on that.,No
22421,I'm just not going to do that.,No
22422,I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.,No
22423,I think we need to invest and save more.,No
22424,I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.,No
22425,I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.,No
22426,We've got to strengthen the family.,No
22427,"Now, let me pose this question to America.",No
22428,"If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?",No
22429,"Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?",No
22430,I hope I'm that person.,No
22431,"Thank you very, very much.",No
22434,"If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.",No
22435,"If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.",No
22439,Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.,Yes
22440,Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.,No
22441,"Sure, you can do that with Congress.",No
22442,Congress -- they're all good people.,No
22443,They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.,No
22446,We have them all day every day.,No
22447,But we get the job done.,No
22448,"Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.",No
22449,I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.,No
22450,And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.,No
22451,Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.,No
22452,Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.,No
22453,Ninety percent are on the honor role.,Yes
22454,Now that will change America.,No
22455,Those children will all go to college.,No
22456,They will live the American dream.,No
22457,"And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.",No
22458,And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.,No
22459,"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.",No
22460,And we have got to put our nation back to work.,No
22461,"Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.",No
22463,"In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.",No
22464,"Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.",No
22465,"I've been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I've paid my share -- over a billion in taxes.",Yes
22466,And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --,No
22470,But it's in your hands.,No
22472,I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.,No
22475,"Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.",No
22476,Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.,No
22477,I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.,No
22478,I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.,No
22479,These problems are not easy.,No
22480,They're not going to be solved overnight.,No
22481,But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.,No
22482,"First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools.",Yes
22483,Our schools are now better.,No
22484,"Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.",No
22486,"This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.",Yes
22488,It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats.,No
22489,"That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.",Yes
22490,You have to decide whether you want to change or not.,No
22491,We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.,No
22492,We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.,Yes
22493,"It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.",No
22494,I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.,Yes
22495,But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.,No
22496,We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.,No
22497,I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.,No
22499,We can do better than that.,No
22500,I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.,No
22551,"But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.",No
22552,I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.,No
22553,"Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.",No
22554,"Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.",Yes
22555,And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.,No
22556,"Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.",Yes
22558,"I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.",No
22559,The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.,No
22560,"No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.",No
22563,But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.,Yes
22564,"Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.",Yes
22565,"You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.",Yes
22566,So I complain about that.,No
22567,I've argued that we should fully funded it.,No
22568,The president says I've changed my mind.,No
22569,I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.,No
22570,So these are the differences.,No
22571,"Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.",Yes
22572,The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.,Yes
22573,I have a plan to put people back to work.,No
22575,I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.,No
22576,The president wants to keep them open.,Yes
22579,I'm going to give you a tax cut.,No
22580,"The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.",Yes
22582,"That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.",No
22584,"Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.",No
22586,"I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.",No
22587,"I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.",Yes
22588,"He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.",Yes
22589,And that sends a confusing signal to people.,No
22590,"He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.",Yes
22591,"No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.",No
22592,"You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.",Yes
22593,"He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.",Yes
22594,"I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.",No
22595,He just brought up the tax cut.,No
22596,"You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.",Yes
22597,That's right at the middle class.,Yes
22599,And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.,No
22600,It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.,No
22601,There's a lot of pressures.,No
22602,And you've got to be firm and consistent.,No
22607,"Each situation is different, Robin.",No
22608,And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.,No
22609,The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.,No
22610,"After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.",No
22611,"After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.",No
22612,"In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.",No
22613,But 9/11 changed it all.,No
22614,I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.,No
22615,That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.,No
22616,Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.,Yes
22617,"That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.",No
22618,"And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.",Yes
22619,"And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.",No
22620,"And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.",No
22621,"And that was the serious, serious threat.",No
22622,"So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.",No
22623,"But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.",Yes
22624,He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.,Yes
22625,"We all thought there was weapons there, Robin.",No
22626,My opponent thought there was weapons there.,No
22627,That's why he called him a grave threat.,No
22628,"I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.",No
22629,But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.,No
22630,And the world is better off without him in power.,No
22631,"And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.",No
22634,"Robin, I'm going to answer your question.",No
22635,"I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.",No
22636,The world is more dangerous today.,No
22637,The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.,No
22638,"Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.",No
22639,He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.,No
22641,"He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.",Yes
22642,He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.,Yes
22643,So what does he do?,No
22644,He's trying to attack me.,No
22645,He wants you to believe that I can't be president.,No
22646,And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.,No
22647,"Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.",No
22648,I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.,No
22649,I always believed he was a threat.,No
22650,Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.,No
22651,I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.,No
22652,"But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.",No
22653,I would have brought our allies to our side.,No
22654,I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.,No
22655,"This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.",No
22656,"And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.",No
22657,"He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.",No
22666,You remember the last debate?,No
22667,My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves.,No
22668,That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.,No
22669,"That's the kind of mindset that said, ""Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well.""",No
22670,Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies.,No
22672,The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.,No
22674,"The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.",Yes
22675,"And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.",Yes
22676,"He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.",Yes
22678,"And if we'd used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq.",No
22679,"And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.",No
22680,That's the war against terror.,No
22687,"I have laid out a different plan, because the president's plan is not working.",No
22688,You see that every night on television.,No
22690,King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can't hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that's going on today.,Yes
22691,"Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.",No
22692,Those are the Republican chairman's words.,No
22693,"Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.",Yes
22694,"Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.",No
22695,"Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.",No
22696,I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.,No
22697,"He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually.",Yes
22698,"Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO.",No
22699,They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.,Yes
22700,Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?,No
22704,Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?,No
22705,"No, because they've always wanted this to be an American effort.",Yes
22706,"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition.""",No
22707,"Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.",No
22708,I'm going to get the training done for our troops.,No
22709,I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.,No
22710,And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.,No
22711,"Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq.",No
22712,He came to see me.,No
22713,And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.,No
22714,Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections.,No
22715,He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold.,No
22716,He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.,No
22717,"He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.",No
22718,"Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.",No
22719,And we need to stand with him.,No
22720,"My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.",No
22721,"We're going to train troops, and we are.",No
22722,"We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.",Yes
22723,We're spending about $7 billion.,Yes
22724,He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.,Yes
22725,And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?,No
22726,Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.,No
22727,Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.,No
22728,Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.,No
22729,I know how these people think.,No
22730,I meet with them all the time.,No
22731,I talk to Tony Blair all the time.,No
22732,I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.,No
22733,They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.,No
22735,We're going to make elections.,No
22736,"And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it.",No
22739,"Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.",No
22740,That was the right place.,No
22741,"And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.",No
22742,"Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.",Yes
22743,"That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime.",No
22744,Now we have to succeed.,No
22747,"Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.",No
22748,"First of all, we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons.",No
22749,"And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.",No
22750,The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.,No
22751,That's what the war on terror is about.,No
22752,"Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.",No
22753,We've already 75 percent of his people.,Yes
22754,And we're on the hunt for him.,Yes
22755,But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.,No
22762,"I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.",No
22764,And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.,No
22765,I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.,No
22767,"He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.",Yes
22768,"Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made.",Yes
22769,I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.,No
22770,But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security.,No
22771,"You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.",No
22772,"I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.",No
22773,And people in Europe didn't like that decision.,No
22774,"And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.",No
22775,"I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism.",No
22776,"I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.",Yes
22777,I don't think we ought to join that.,No
22779,"And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.",No
22780,We'll continue to reach out.,No
22781,"Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.",Yes
22783,"Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.",No
22784,You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.,No
22786,"Nikki, that's a question that's been raised by a lot of people around the country.",No
22787,"Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.",No
22788,"The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, ""Under what circumstances would you send people to war?""",Yes
22789,"And his answer was, ""With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done.""",Yes
22792,We didn't have enough forces.,No
22793,"General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.",Yes
22795,They retired General Shinseki for telling him that.,Yes
22797,I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.,No
22798,I went to New York.,No
22799,I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.,No
22800,"I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.",No
22801,"But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, ""Nope.",Yes
22802,"Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.",No
22804,He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.,No
22805,"Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.",Yes
22809,"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?",No
22810,"Do you have what it takes?""",No
22811,"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?""",No
22812,"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr.",No
22814,"Of course, I listen to our generals.",No
22815,That's what a president does.,No
22816,A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.,No
22818,"You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.",No
22819,"General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, ""You're going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace.""",Yes
22820,The military's job is to win the war.,No
22821,A president's job is to win the peace.,No
22822,The president did not do what was necessary.,No
22823,Didn't bring in enough nation.,No
22825,Didn't close off the borders.,No
22826,Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.,Yes
22827,And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.,No
22835,"I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.",No
22836,"But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.",No
22837,"And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.",No
22838,"If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.",Yes
22839,"Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.",Yes
22840,"For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.",Yes
22841,We were safer before President Bush came to office.,No
22842,Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.,Yes
22843,So what do we do?,No
22844,"We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.",No
22845,We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.,No
22846,"But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.",No
22847,"At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.",Yes
22848,I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.,No
22849,And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.,Yes
22850,It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.,No
22851,I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.,No
22852,"And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.",No
22854,That answer almost made me want to scowl.,No
22855,"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job.""",No
22856,It's naive and dangerous to say that.,No
22857,That's what the Duelfer report showed.,Yes
22858,He was deceiving the inspectors.,Yes
22859,"Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.",No
22860,I fully understand the threat.,No
22861,"And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.",No
22863,Let me talk about North Korea.,No
22864,"It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.",No
22865,"Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.",Yes
22866,"He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.",No
22867,That's what President Clinton did.,No
22868,He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.,Yes
22870,He didn't honor the agreement.,Yes
22872,That is a bad policy.,No
22873,"Of course, we're paying attention to these.",No
22874,It's a great question about Iran.,No
22875,"That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an ""Axis of Evil,"" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it.",Yes
22881,"Yes, that's a great question.",No
22883,I hear there's rumors on the Internets (sic) that we're going to have a draft.,No
22884,"We're not going to have a draft, period.",No
22885,The all- volunteer army works.,No
22886,It works particularly when we pay our troops well.,No
22887,"It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.",Yes
22888,"An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.",No
22889,We don't need mass armies anymore.,No
22890,One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.,Yes
22891,And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.,Yes
22892,We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.,No
22893,"In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.",No
22894,And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.,Yes
22895,"So to answer your question is, we're withdrawing, not from the world, we're withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there's less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be -- we'll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army.",No
22896,One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.,No
22897,There are some really interesting technologies.,No
22898,"For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.",Yes
22899,"That saves manpower, and it saves equipment.",No
22900,"It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained.",No
22901,"Now, forget all this talk about a draft.",No
22902,We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.,No
22904,"Daniel, I don't support a draft.",No
22905,But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.,No
22906,"The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.",Yes
22908,Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president.,No
22909,Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.,No
22910,You've got people doing two and three rotations.,Yes
22911,"You've got stop-loss policies, so people can't get out when they were supposed to.",No
22912,You've got a back-door draft right now.,No
22913,And a lot of our military are underpaid.,Yes
22914,These are families that get hurt.,No
22915,It hurts the middle class.,No
22916,"It hurts communities, because these are our first responders.",No
22918,"And they're over there, not over here.",No
22919,"Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.",No
22920,We're going to build alliances.,No
22921,We're not going to go unilaterally.,No
22922,We're not going to go alone like this president did.,Yes
22924,Let me just -- I've got to answer this.,No
22928,"Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.",No
22930,You tell Tony Blair we're going alone.,No
22931,Tell Tony Blair we're going alone.,No
22932,Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone.,No
22933,Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone.,No
22934,There are 30 countries there.,No
22935,"It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.",No
22936,"You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.",No
22940,"Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining.",Yes
22941,Eight countries have left it.,Yes
22942,"If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.",Yes
22943,That's not a grand coalition.,No
22944,Ninety percent of the casualties are American.,Yes
22945,Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets.,Yes
22946,I could do a better job.,No
22947,My plan does a better job.,No
22948,And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.,No
22953,"Thank you very much, Ann.",No
22954,"I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.",No
22955,"This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.",No
22957,The when I can't tell you.,No
22958,"Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.",Yes
22962,I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.,No
22963,"I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.",No
22964,You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.,No
22965,"And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.",No
22966,"Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.",No
22967,We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.,No
22968,I'm going to change that.,No
22969,And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.,No
22970,"Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.",Yes
22971,"When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn't X-rayed.",No
22973,"This president in the last debate said, ""Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that.""",No
22974,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.",No
22975,He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible.,Yes
22976,"We have bridges and tunnels that aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.",No
22977,"If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?",No
22978,This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.,Yes
22981,"That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.",Yes
22982,"Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.",No
22983,"My opponent's right, we need good intelligence.",No
22984,It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.,Yes
22985,The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.,No
22986,"We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once.",No
22988,And there's a lot of good people working hard.,No
22989,We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.,No
22990,That's why the Patriot Act was important.,No
22991,"The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.",No
22992,It's a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other.,No
22993,My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.,Yes
22994,"No, but he's for weakening it.",No
22995,I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.,No
22996,"First of all, I don't think he can succeed in Iraq.",No
22997,"And if Iraq were to fail, it'd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous.",No
22998,I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.,No
22999,I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.,No
23000,I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.,No
23001,"This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.",No
23006,"Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.",No
23007,And I accept what the president has said.,No
23008,"These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.",No
23010,That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.,No
23011,But you heard the president just say to you that we've added money.,Yes
23012,"Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.",No
23013,He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you.,No
23015,"Well, we'll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute.",No
23018,I'm worried about our country.,No
23019,"And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.",No
23020,And the reason I'm worried is because there's a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate.,No
23021,"And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.",No
23023,And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.,No
23029,Just want to make sure they're safe.,No
23030,"When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't kill you.",No
23031,And that's why the FDA and that's why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way.,No
23032,I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.,No
23033,"And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like it's from Canada, and it might be from a third world.",No
23034,"And we've just got to make sure, before somebody thinks they're buying a product, that it works.",No
23035,And that's why we're doing what we're doing.,No
23036,"Now, it may very well be here in December you'll hear me say, I think there's a safe way to do it.",No
23037,There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.,No
23038,"One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.",No
23039,"Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand -- brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs.",Yes
23040,And we're doing just that.,No
23041,"Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they're working.",No
23042,"Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.",No
23044,"And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.",Yes
23045,Because I went to Washington to fix problems.,No
23046,"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare.""",No
23047,People didn't want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically.,No
23048,I wanted to get something done.,No
23049,I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system.,No
23050,"And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage.",No
23053,"John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.",No
23054,"Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?",No
23055,You know what he said?,No
23056,"""I think that makes sense.",No
23057,"I think that's a good idea"" -- four years ago.",No
23058,"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that.""",No
23059,"Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.",No
23060,"He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate.",Yes
23061,"We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs.",Yes
23062,We took care of the safety issues.,Yes
23063,We're not talking about third-world drugs.,No
23064,We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles.,No
23065,And we're asking to be able to allow you to get them.,No
23067,"The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you.",Yes
23068,And he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors.,No
23069,You know what he did?,No
23070,"He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.",Yes
23071,"does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower.",No
23072,He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets.,Yes
23073,That's the difference between us.,No
23074,"The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies.",No
23075,"And I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I'm fighting to let Medicare survive.",Yes
23076,I'm fighting for the middle class.,No
23078,"If they're safe, they're coming.",No
23079,I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.,No
23080,"President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.",No
23081,"Now, he talks about Medicare.",No
23082,He's been in the United States Senate 20 years.,No
23083,Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished.,No
23084,"I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.",Yes
23085,That's what leadership is all about.,No
23086,"Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.",Yes
23087,"We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.",Yes
23089,And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.,Yes
23090,He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.,Yes
23097,John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.,No
23098,He wanted to give people rights.,No
23099,John Edwards and I support tort reform.,No
23100,"We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.",No
23101,And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.,No
23102,It's in my health-care proposal.,Yes
23104,You can pull it off of the Internet.,No
23105,And you'll find a tort reform plan.,No
23106,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.",No
23109,"Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others?",No
23111,But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.,Yes
23112,Your premiums are going up.,Yes
23113,"You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.",Yes
23114,You've gone up 64 percent.,Yes
23115,"You've seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up.",Yes
23117,Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.,Yes
23118,He's done nothing about it.,Yes
23120,I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you.,No
23121,I have a plan to cover all children.,No
23122,I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves.,No
23123,I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.,No
23124,"And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable.",No
23125,"Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.",No
23127,"Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.",Yes
23129,Let me see where to start here.,No
23130,"First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all.",Yes
23131,And that's saying something in that bunch.,No
23132,You might say that took a lot of hard work.,No
23133,"The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.",Yes
23135,He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.,No
23137,And what are his health programs?,No
23138,"First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.",Yes
23139,There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.,No
23140,"Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.",Yes
23141,That shows a lack of understanding.,No
23142,Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.,Yes
23143,"And finally, he said he's going to have a novel health care plan.",No
23144,You know what it is?,No
23145,The federal government is going to run it.,No
23146,It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever.,Yes
23147,And it fits with his philosophy.,No
23148,That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.,No
23150,They create government-sponsored health care.,Yes
23151,Maybe you think that makes sense.,No
23153,Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.,No
23154,It would ruin the quality of health care in America.,No
23161,"Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.",No
23162,"But look, what's really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around.",Yes
23163,"I mean, ""compassionate conservative,"" what does that mean?",No
23164,"Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.",Yes
23165,"Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.",No
23166,"I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.",No
23167,What means something is: Do you have a plan?,No
23168,And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.,No
23171,"You're right, what does matter is a plan.",No
23172,He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?,No
23174,You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.,No
23175,"Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.",Yes
23176,He's been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasn't addressed it.,Yes
23177,We passed it out of the House of Representatives.,Yes
23179,"It's stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers won't act on it.",Yes
23180,And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket.,No
23186,"Right, thank you for that.",No
23188,We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.,Yes
23189,"You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped.",Yes
23190,And that cost us revenue.,No
23193,"And I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.",Yes
23194,We've got to pay our troops more.,No
23196,We've increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security.,Yes
23197,I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.,Yes
23198,I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.,No
23199,"And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.",Yes
23200,"Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.",No

23207,"Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office.",Yes

23445,"Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.",Yes
23446,"Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level.",Yes

23450,"You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.",No
23452,"I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.",No
23454,"But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that's what I'm talking about.",No

23456,"Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.",Yes

23485,So I really don't think so.,No
23486,I hope you don't think that.,No
23487,"I mean, I -- because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.",No

23536,I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure.,No

23550,"And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life.",No
23552,"Well, you talk about walking a waffle line -- he says he's allowed it, which means he's going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount and then he isn't going to allow it.",No
23553,I don't know how you draw that line.,No
23554,"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated.",Yes
23555,We've got to open up the possibilities of this research.,No
23556,"And when I am president, I'm going to do it because we have to.",No
23558,Let me make sure you understand my decision.,No
23559,Those stem- cells lines already existed.,Yes
23560,The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision.,Yes
23561,"I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life -- I made the decision to balance science and ethics.",No
23566,I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.,No
23569,I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law.,No
23570,I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States.,No
23571,"Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.",No
23572,"I wouldn't pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn't be said in a school because it had the words ""under God"" in it.",No
23573,I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.,No
23574,"Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights.",Yes
23576,That's not what the Constitution says.,No
23577,"The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that.",No
23578,It doesn't speak to the equality of America.,No
23579,"And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists.",No
23580,"We've got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C.",No
23581,Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution.,No
23582,And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year -- the next four years.,No
23583,And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.,No
23584,No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.,No
23588,"A few years ago when he came to office, the president said -- these are his words -- ""What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts.""",No
23589,And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.,No
23590,So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.,No
23591,"Now, here's what I believe.",No
23592,"I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.",No
23593,I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.,No
23594,I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.,No
23595,He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.,No
23596,"And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when you're reading their decision, their opinion, you can't tell if it's written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.",No
23597,You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.,No
23598,"What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.",No
23599,"The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law.",No
23600,Will we have equal opportunity?,No
23601,Will women's rights be protected?,No
23602,"Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?",No
23603,Will a woman's right to choose be protected?,No
23604,"These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.",No
23608,I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.,No
23609,"First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.",No
23610,"I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.",No
23612,Religion has been a huge part of my life.,No
23613,"It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.",No
23614,"But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.",No
23616,But I can counsel people.,No
23617,I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility.,No
23618,"I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.",No
23619,"But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.",No
23620,And I have to make that judgment.,No
23621,"Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.",No
23622,"And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.",No
23623,That's why I think it's important.,No
23624,"That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.",No
23626,"You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.",No
23627,"You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.",No
23628,And I truly respect it.,No
23630,I'm trying to decipher that.,No
23631,"My answer is, we're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.",No
23632,"This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.",No
23633,I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.,Yes
23635,It's one way to help reduce abortions.,No
23636,My opponent voted against the ban.,Yes
23637,I think there ought to be parental notification laws.,No
23639,I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.,No
23640,"In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.",Yes
23641,My opponent was against that.,Yes
23642,These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.,No
23643,I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.,No
23644,I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.,No
23645,"And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.",Yes
23646,Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.,No
23650,"Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.",No
23651,"You know, it's just not that simple.",No
23653,"I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.",No
23654,"Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.",No
23655,So you got to have a judicial intervention.,No
23656,"And because they didn't have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.",Yes
23657,It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.,No
23659,"Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?",No
23661,"And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no.",Yes
23662,And that's just the way it is.,No
23665,It's clear for everybody to see.,No
23666,And as I said: You can run but you can't hide the reality.,No
23670,Put a head fake on us.,No
23677,"I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big.",No
23678,"And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.",No
23679,He shouldn't have made that decision.,No
23680,And I'll take responsibility for them.,No
23682,"But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.",No
23683,"That's really what you're -- when they ask about the mistakes, that's what they're talking about.",No
23684,"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?""",No
23685,"And the answer is, ""Absolutely not.""",No
23686,It was the right decision.,No
23687,"The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.",Yes
23688,And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.,No
23689,We knew he hated us.,No
23690,We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.,Yes
23691,We knew he tortured his own people.,Yes
23692,"On the tax cut, it's a big decision.",No
23693,I did the right decision.,No
23694,Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.,Yes
23695,"Now, you asked what mistakes.",No
23696,"I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.",No
23697,I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.,No
23699,"But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.",No
23701,"I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.",Yes
23702,"I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.",No
23704,Was this really going to war as a last resort?,No
23705,The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.,Yes
23706,And simple things weren't done.,No
23707,That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.,Yes
23708,"That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.",No
23709,"We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.",Yes
23710,That ammo is now being used against our kids.,No
23711,"Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees aren't armored.",Yes
23712,"I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles.",No
23713,They didn't have the right body armor.,Yes
23714,I've met parents who've on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids.,No
23715,There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.,No
23716,"And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.",No
23718,"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.""",Yes
23719,"Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.",No
23720,And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.,No
23721,"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off.""",No
23723,"Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion.",No
23724,I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.,No
23725,He made a mistake in invading Iraq.,No
23726,Which is a worse decision?,No
23727,"Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.",No
23728,I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.,No
23729,"I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen.",No
23730,He wants your kids to pay for it.,No
23731,"I wanted us to pay for it, since we're at war.",No
23732,I don't think that's a bad decision.,No
23737,Do you want to go first?,No
23742,"Thank you, all of you, for taking part.",No
23744,Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.,No
23745,I respect him for that.,No
23746,But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.,No
23747,I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.,No
23748,"I'll never give a veto over American security to any other entity -- not a nation, not a country, not an institution.",No
23749,"But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.",No
23750,And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.,Yes
23751,We are not doing that today.,No
23753,I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.,No
23754,And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists.,No
23755,"But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.",No
23756,"In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up.",Yes
23757,I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans.,No
23758,I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind.,No
23759,I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.,Yes
23762,"I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.",No
23764,And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.,No
23769,Thank you all very much.,No
23771,"The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.",No
23772,"We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.",No
23773,And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.,Yes
23774,The farm income in America is high.,Yes
23776,Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.,Yes
23778,"Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.",No
23779,"And abroad, we're at war.",No
23780,And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.,No
23781,I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.,No
23782,The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.,Yes
23783,There is more work to be done.,No
23784,We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida.,No
23785,We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.,No
23786,We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.,No
23788,The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.,No
23789,But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty.,No
23790,And we'll continue to promote freedom around the world.,No
23791,Freedom is on the march.,No
23792,"Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.",No
23793,"In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.",No
23820,I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.,Yes
23822,This is a movement that came from the people.,No
23823,"This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.",No
23825,The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.,No
23826,"I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.",No
23827,So this comes from the people.,No
23829,"The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth.",No
23830,"But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.",No
23831,"Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years you've had it your way.",No
23832,You've had your chance and it didn't work.,No
23834,I want to bring that change to the American people.,No
23835,But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.,No
23837,"Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.",No
23838,I think we've dramatically changed the world.,No
23839,"I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.",No
23840,Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.,No
23841,And change for change sake isn't enough.,No
23842,"We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof.",Yes
23843,But my economic program is the kind of change we want.,No
23844,And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.,No
23845,A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.,No
23846,"I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.",No
23847,"But I'd say, if you had to separate out, I think it's experience at this level.",No
23851,"Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.",No
23852,I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.,No
23853,"My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.",Yes
23854,That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.,No
23856,"You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.",No
23857,We have got to have the courage to change.,No
23859,I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.,No
23860,"I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.",No
23861,I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.,No
23862,"We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in.",Yes
23863,Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.,Yes
23867,"We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.",No
23869,And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.,No
23870,"Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.",No
23872,I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.,No
23873,"I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.",No
23874,"He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams.",No
23875,"Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.",No
23876,"But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes.",No
23877,We're the United States of America.,No
23878,"In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world.",No
23879,Many would trade for it.,No
23880,We've been caught up in a global slowdown.,No
23881,"We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.",No
23882,I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.,No
23883,"Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting.",No
23884,"But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people I'm listening to.",No
23886,"Well, they've got a point.",No
23887,I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt.,No
23889,I don't have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.,No
23890,"I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.",No
23891,Ã‚ But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done.,No
23892,"So, if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one.",No
23893,I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.,No
23894,"So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.",No
23899,I think the American people should be the judge of that.,No
23900,I think character is a very important question.,No
23901,I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.,No
23902,I just think it's wrong.,No
23903,"I -- well, maybe they say, ""Well, it was a youthful indiscretion.""",No
23904,I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.,No
23907,"They get on me -- Bill's gotten on me about, ""read my lips.""",No
23908,When I make a mistake I'll admit it.,No
23909,But he has made -- not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land -- organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted.,Yes
23910,"Some say, ""well, you're a little old fashioned.""",No
23911,"Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.",No
23912,"Now, whether it's character or judgment -- whatever it is -- I have a big difference here on this issue and so we'll just have to see how it plays out.",No
23913,But I -- I couldn't do that.,No
23914,And I don't think most Americans could do that.,No
23915,"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago.""",No
23916,"Well, let's admit it then.",No
23917,"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake.""",No
23918,"How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, ""Well, I'm not going to go.",No
23919,The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era.,No
23920,So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.,No
23921,I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.,No
23923,I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.,No
23924,I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way.,No
23926,Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.,No
23927,"But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.",No
23928,"Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?",No
23929,Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?,No
23930,"When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket.",No
23931,"If you make it as a young man, time passes.",No
23932,"So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us.",No
23933,Decide who you think will do the job.,No
23934,"Pick that person in November because believe me, as I've said before, ""The party's over and it's time for the clean-up crew.""",No
23935,And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge --,No
23942,Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.,No
23943,You have questioned my patriotism.,No
23945,"You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.",Yes
23946,"Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.",No
23947,But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.,No
23949,And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush.,No
23950,"Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.",No
23951,"I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.",No
23953,I want to lead a unified country.,No
23960,"The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above.",Yes
23961,Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.,Yes
23962,"Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.",Yes
23963,So that is where my income limit would trigger.,No
23968,"--notwithstanding my opponent's ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above.",Yes
23969,"Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.",No
23970,"In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.",No
23973,We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.,No
23974,"We need to say here's your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way.",No
23975,"I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.",Yes
23976,"We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.",Yes
23977,"We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.",No
23979,"Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.",No
23980,I didn't question the man's patriotism.,No
23981,I questioned his judgment and his character.,No
23982,"What he did in Moscow, that's fine.",No
23986,What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.,No
23989,In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us.,No
23990,I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.,No
23992,"Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.",Yes
23994,That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.,No
23995,And so I just have a different approach.,No
23996,"I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.",No
23997,We've got a big difference there.,No
24000,"We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.",No
24001,"Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, it's minimum-wage jobs.",Yes
24002,So we've got to really rebuild our job base.,No
24003,That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that.,No
24004,Our foreign competitors are doing it; we're not.,Yes
24005,"We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue.",Yes
24006,We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.,No
24008,It's got to be fair.,No
24009,"We've created a mess, don't have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.",No
24015,"Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.",Yes
24018,I have cut defense spending.,Yes
24019,And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War.,No
24020,We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending.,No
24021,I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.,No
24022,We simply cannot pull back.,No
24023,"Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let's cut money out of the Defense Dept.",No
24024,"I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney.",No
24025,They feel that the levels we're operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper.,No
24026,And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners.,No
24027,"We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that.",No
24028,And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.,No
24029,"But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.",No
24030,And I don't want to do that.,No
24032,Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending.,Yes
24033,"But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.",No
24034,"Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.",No
24035,"But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary.",No
24036,"I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right.",No
24038,"If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.",No
24039,"But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.",No
24040,"Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.",Yes
24041,"For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.",Yes
24042,It's kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country.,No
24043,The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.,Yes
24044,"I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.",No
24045,We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it.,No
24046,"They don't want us to control it, very candidly.",No
24051,"I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.",No
24052,We certainly must maintain an engagement there.,No
24053,"There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US.",No
24054,"But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.",Yes
24055,Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.,No
24056,"We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane.",No
24057,We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly.,No
24058,"And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.",Yes
24059,"I don't think we need 150,000 troops.",No
24060,Let me make one other point.,No
24061,Mr. Bush talked about taxes.,No
24062,He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.,Yes
24068,It's 10 cents a year cumulative.,Yes
24069,It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year.,Yes
24070,"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word.",No
24071,"Again, see, I didn't create this problem.",Yes
24072,We're trying to solve it.,No
24073,"Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.",Yes
24074,"We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.",Yes
24075,"I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.",No
24076,But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax.,No
24078,"Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.",No
24079,"And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.",No
24080,We have spent $4 trillion worth.,Yes
24081,An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.,No
24082,I think it's fitting that we're on the campus of a university tonight.,No
24083,"These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.",No
24084,"We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them.",No
24085,We've got to collect the taxes to do it.,No
24086,"If there's a fairer way, I'm all ears (laughter) --aah.",No
24088,"If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.",No
24090,I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.,No
24092,"I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think it's important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one.",Yes
24093,"We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit.",Yes
24094,"People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.",Yes
24095,"The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.",Yes
24096,That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.,No
24097,"We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.",No
24098,We've got to invest and grow.,No
24099,"9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.",Yes
24101,Your question was on fairness.,No
24102,I just disagree with Mr. Perot.,No
24103,"I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.",No
24104,I don't think we need to do it.,No
24106,"I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.",No
24107,"But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.",No
24108,I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.,No
24109,"You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.",No
24110,And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.,No
24111,I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.,No
24112,He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.,No
24113,"I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for the rich.",No
24115,I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.,No
24116,"And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.",No
24124,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes.",No
24125,"I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.",No
24126,"And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way.",No
24127,So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.,Yes
24128,"I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining.",No
24129,"When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work.",No
24130,"If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.",No
24131,"I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.",No
24132,Therein is the best answer to her.,No
24133,And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.,No
24134,"I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.",No
24135,"With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.",Yes
24136,I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.,No
24137,But it is a good program.,No
24139,"But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.",No
24140,Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.,No
24141,It was just right through the roof.,No
24142,"Now, we can do better.",No
24143,"And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.",No
24144,I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.,No
24148,Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.,No
24150,"And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.",No
24151,And there will be a significant transition.,No
24152,And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.,No
24153,We had someone who I'm sure regrets said it in the president's staff said he didn't care whether we made potato chips or computer chips.,No
24154,"Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.",No
24155,"Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.",Yes
24156,We've given away whole industries.,Yes
24157,"So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.",No
24158,"A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that's where the high-paying jobs are.",No
24159,We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.,No
24160,"Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.",No
24161,The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.,No
24162,"I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.",No
24163,"In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.",No
24165,We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.,No
24167,"There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.",Yes
24168,That is what I want to do.,No
24169,"This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.",Yes
24170,"I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies.",No
24171,"Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.",No
24179,"Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.",No
24180,And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.,No
24182,There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.,No
24183,It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.,No
24184,You don't have anywhere to sleep.,No
24185,"Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.",No
24186,"Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.",No
24187,"The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.",No
24188,Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.,No
24189,Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.,No
24190,"See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.",No
24191,"Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.",No
24192,"Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety.",No
24193,"Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.",No
24194,"And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.",No
24195,Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans.,No
24196,"By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.",No
24197,Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.,No
24198,"Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, ""Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?""",No
24200,"Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.",No
24201,"Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.",No
24202,And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.,No
24204,"This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.",No
24205,"I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.",No
24206,Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.,No
24207,"Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.",No
24208,It is the number one culprit.,No
24210,"I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.",Yes
24211,We've done it in Arkansas.,Yes
24212,Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.,No
24217,We've got the plan announced for what we can do for small business.,No
24218,"I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers.",No
24219,"What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.",No
24220,"We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.",No
24221,"Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.",No
24222,"And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans.",No
24223,The plans are all over Washington.,No
24224,"And I've put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, it's sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need.",No
24225,And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.,No
24232,"But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today.",No
24233,We have low interest rates today.,Yes
24234,At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.,No
24235,Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.,Yes
24236,"And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.",Yes
24237,"But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.",No
24239,I think the American people are ready for action.,No
24240,I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.,No
24241,"Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.",Yes
24242,Give me a chance to do that.,No
24243,I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.,No
24244,"Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.",No
24247,There is a separation there.,No
24250,"I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets.",No
24251,"There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that.",No
24252,"So I don't think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong.",No
24253,It's been very strong since I've been president.,No
24254,"And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.",No
24257,"And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.",No
24258,I think the government's spending too much.,No
24259,So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.,No
24260,"I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.",No
24261,IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to protect them.,No
24263,"Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality.",No
24264,"We live in a global economy, not a national economy.",No
24265,These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.,No
24266,"We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.",Yes
24267,So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.,Yes
24269,"We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.",Yes
24270,"That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.",No

24634,Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.,No
24635,"If you're going to die, you don't have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs.",No
24636,"Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk.",No
24637,And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.,No
24638,So I would think we can expedite the problem there.,No
24640,"The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.",No
24642,"2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.",No
24643,"But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.",No
24644,That's how strongly I feel about it.,No
24647,"Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.",Yes
24649,We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.,No
24650,We need to accelerate the drug approval process.,No
24651,We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we're doing everything we can on research and treatment.,No
24652,"And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.",No
24653,This is a matter of life and death.,No
24654,I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children.,Yes
24656,The reason Magic Johnson resigned from the AIDS Commission is because the statement you heard tonight from Mr. Bush is the longest and best statement he's made about it in public.,Yes
24657,"I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.",No
24664,"Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --",No
24666,#NAME?,No
24667,I will have a unique mandate.,No
24668,"I have said again and again, and this really upsets the establishment in Washington, that we're going to inform the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what's going on.",No
24669,They will want to do what's good for our country.,No
24670,"Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --",No
24672,"-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.",No
24673,"And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.",No
24674,They're not as stupid as Washington thinks they are.,No
24675,"The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.",No
24676,And they will make those sacrifices.,No
24677,"So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --",No
24679,"-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.",No
24680,"Now, everybody will faint in Washington.",No
24681,They've never seen anything happen in that town.,No
24684,"And I'm sitting there and saying, well, who else could be around, you know?",No
24685,"Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.",No
24687,"And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.",No
24688,"No, we'll get it done.",No
24691,"Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.",No
24695,"The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.",Yes
24696,The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.,Yes
24697,"But if you don't have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you can't fix this problem.",No
24698,Costs will continue to spiral.,No
24699,"And just remember this, folks.",No
24700,"A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine.",Yes
24701,"I've met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire.",No
24702,"All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.",No
24704,"When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.",No
24707,"Well, first place, I'd like to clear up something because every 4 years, the Democrats go around and say, Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare.",No
24709,"I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.",Yes
24710,I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.,No
24712,"And Ross properly says, okay, there's some pain in that.",No
24713,"But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses.",Yes
24714,"So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.",No
24715,"And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.",No
24716,I just don't believe we ought to do that.,No
24717,So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.,No
24723,Mr. Bush made that charge.,Yes
24729,I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.,No
24730,"Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.",No
24731,Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race.,No
24732,I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care.,No
24733,I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare.,No
24735,"The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.",Yes
24737,More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.,Yes
24738,"If you don't control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it.",No
24740,"We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government.",Yes
24741,"We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states.",No
24742,And we control private and public health care costs.,Yes
24743,"Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.",Yes
24744,I've got a plan to control health care costs.,No
24745,"But you can't just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies.",No
24746,"And you have to have cost controls, yes.",No
24747,"But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.",Yes
24749,"I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.",Yes
24750,I'm tired of being told we can't.,No
24755,"Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.",No
24756,"The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled.",No
24757,"As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.",Yes
24758,Maybe we can work it out.,No
24759,"But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.",No
24760,Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.,No
24761,"He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.",Yes
24762,"And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits.",Yes
24763,"If you want to help somebody, don't run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he's afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him.",No
24764,We're suing each other too much and caring for each other too little.,No
24768,So we don't have the best.,No
24769,"Pretty simple, folks -- if you're paying more and you don't have the best, if all else fails go copy the people who have the best who spend less, right?",No
24770,"Well, we can do better than that.",No
24771,"Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.",No
24773,Now I'm back to square one.,No
24774,"If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.",No
24775,"But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.",No
24776,"Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.",No
24777,Let's get on with it.,No
24784,"Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.",No
24785,I make no bones about it.,No
24787,I love the principle it's founded on.,No
24788,I love the people here.,No
24789,I don't like to see the country's principles violated.,No
24791,The people in Washington are good people.,No
24792,We just have a bad system.,No
24793,We've got to change the system.,No
24795,We've got to put our house in order.,No
24796,"When you go to bed tonight, look at your children.",No
24799,Isn't it time to stop creating images?,No
24800,Isn't it time to do it?,No
24801,Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?,No
24802,"Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.",No
24803,"They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget.",No
24804,They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.,Yes
24805,That's Washington in a nutshell right there.,No
24806,"In the final analysis, I'm doing this for your children when you look at them tonight.",No
24807,"There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.",No
24808,"I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.",No
24809,And I can't tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes -- and I know how you feel and you know how I feel.,No
24810,And then I think of the older people who are retired.,No
24811,They grew up in the Depression.,No
24812,They fought and won World War II.,No
24813,We owe you a debt we can never repay you.,No
24814,And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.,No
24815,"I'll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it.",No
24818,"I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.",No
24820,"Most of all, I'd like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom I've seen.",No
24822,"I'd like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change.",Yes
24823,I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.,No
24824,"I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change.",No
24825,"This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.",No
24826,Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.,No
24828,I offer a new direction.,No
24829,"Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.",No
24830,"I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.",No
24833,Let me tell you a little what it's like to be president.,No
24834,"In the Oval Office, you can't predict what kind of crisis is going to come up.",No
24835,You have to make tough calls.,No
24836,You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.,No
24837,You can't take different positions on these difficult issues.,No
24838,And then you need a philosophical -- I'd call it a philosophical underpinning.,No
24839,"Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world.",No
24840,The Cold War is over.,Yes
24841,The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.,Yes
24842,"Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.",Yes
24843,Take a look at the Middle East.,No
24844,We had to stand up against a tyrant.,No
24845,"The US came together as we haven't in many, many years.",No
24846,And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.,Yes
24847,"And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.",Yes
24848,Nobody would have dreamed it possible.,No
24849,And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.,No
24850,Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.,No
24854,What we need to do is empower people.,No
24855,We need to invest and save.,No
24856,We need to do better in education.,No
24857,We need to do better in job retraining.,No
24858,"We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.",No
24859,And we need to strengthen the American family.,No
24860,I hope as president that I've earned your trust.,No
24861,"I've admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems.",No
24862,I hope I've earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.,No
24864,"Thank you very, very much.",No
24900,I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.,No
24901,"Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.",No
24902,"To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.",No
24903,That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace,Yes
24904,This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.,No
24905,"I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.",Yes
24906,"A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.",No
24907,"We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.",Yes
24908,"But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.",No
24909,"The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead.",No
24910,"And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.",Yes
24911,A President is called the Commander in Chief.,No
24912,And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.,No
24917,"We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did.",No
24919,You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.,No
24920,That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.,No
24921,"That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.",No
24923,"We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.",No
24927,"No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.",No
24928,I have ordered an investigation.,Yes
24929,I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.,Yes
24930,"We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.",Yes
24931,And he drew up this manual.,No
24932,It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.,Yes
24933,"And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.",Yes
24934,"But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.",Yes
24935,"Now, those are the details as we have them.",No
24936,"And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.",No
24937,We'll take the proper action at the proper time.,No
24938,"I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.",Yes
24939,"So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.",No
24940,"But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.",No
24943,I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.,No
24944,There's not someone there directing all of this activity.,No
24945,"There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.",No
24946,"And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.",Yes
24948,What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?,No
24949,He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.,No
24950,"A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.",No
24951,"This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.",Yes
24952,"Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.",No
24954,How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?,No
24955,A President must know these things.,No
24956,"I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.",No
24957,And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?,No
24958,"This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.",No
24961,"I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.",No
24962,"You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.",Yes
24963,"I never, ever conceived of such a thing.",No
24964,I never said any such thing.,No
24965,"In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.",Yes
24966,"But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.",No
24967,"How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.",No
24968,"So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.",No
24969,I'm sure that you appreciate that.,No
24978,I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.,No
24979,I retract nothing that I have said.,No
24980,I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.,No
24981,"But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.",No
24982,And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.,No
24984,"And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.",No
24985,"But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.",No
24986,"And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.",No
24987,And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.,No
24988,I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.,No
24989,"I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.",Yes
24990,And the result was unilateral disarmament.,Yes
24991,We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.,Yes
24994,"The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.",Yes
24995,And now we are putting up a defense of our own.,Yes
24996,"And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.",No
24997,We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.,No
24998,"Now, they claim they're not.",Yes
24999,"And I made it plain to them, we're not.",No
25000,There's been no change in my attitude at all.,No
25001,I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.,No
25002,And we did get their attention.,No
25008,"Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.",No
25009,"I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.",No
25010,"One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.",No
25011,Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.,No
25012,"We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.",Yes
25013,"So, I can say there are a great many interests.",No
25014,I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.,No
25015,That is where I think the future of the world lies.,No
25016,"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''",No
25017,I don't want to send troops any place.,No
25027,"Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.",Yes
25028,I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.,No
25029,"They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.",No
25030,"Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.",No
25031,"And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.",Yes
25032,"And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.",Yes
25033,"There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.",Yes
25034,"We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.",No
25035,There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.,No
25036,I will keep this nation strong.,No
25037,"I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.",No
25038,"To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.",No
25039,"And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.",No
25040,He's 3 years into this administration.,No
25041,"He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.",Yes
25042,I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.,No
25043,"He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.",Yes
25045,A President must know those things.,No
25050,I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.,No
25051,We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.,No
25052,"We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.",No
25053,"Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.",No
25054,Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.,No
25055,That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.,No
25058,I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.,No
25059,"But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F - 14's take off.",No
25060,"And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.",Yes
25062,"He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.",Yes
25063,And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.,No
25065,"Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.",No
25066,"And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.",Yes
25068,"Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.",No
25069,"[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.",No
25070,I'll tell you where we disagree.,No
25071,"It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.",Yes
25072,The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.,Yes
25073,Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.,No
25074,My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.,No
25075,There's a big difference between the two of us.,No
25076,A President must manage that budget.,No
25077,"I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.",No
25078,"You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.",No
25086,"As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.",No
25087,And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.,No
25088,"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.",Yes
25089,"And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.",No
25090,"Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.",No
25091,"We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.",No
25092,And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.,No
25093,"We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.",No
25094,"We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.",No
25095,It is only in that way that we can persevere.,No
25101,"What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.",Yes
25102,"The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.",No
25103,"And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.",Yes
25108,"No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.",No
25109,"First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.",Yes
25110,"But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.",Yes
25111,Israel could not be blamed for that.,No
25112,"Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.",Yes
25113,"Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.",Yes
25115,And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.,Yes
25117,We were there for the better part of a year.,No
25118,Our position happened to be at the airport.,No
25119,"Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.",No
25120,"I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.",No
25121,And this is what we did.,No
25122,We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.,Yes
25123,"But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.",Yes
25124,"We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.",No
25125,"There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.",No
25126,"And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.",Yes
25127,Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.,Yes
25128,But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.,Yes
25129,And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.,No
25134,"I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.",No
25135,"In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.",No
25136,"In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.",Yes
25137,The most recent has been the one in Brighton.,No
25138,"In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.",No
25139,"I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.",Yes
25140,"And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.",Yes
25141,"Well, the red light went on.",No
25142,I could have gone on forever.,No
25144,"Groucho Marx said, ""Who do you believe?",No
25145,"-- me, or your own eyes?''",No
25146,And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.,No
25147,The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.,Yes
25148,"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''",Yes
25149,The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.,No
25150,He did not do so.,Yes
25151,The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.,Yes
25152,That was the second time.,No
25153,"Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.",Yes
25154,"And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.",Yes
25155,The terrorists have won each time.,No
25156,The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.,Yes
25159,"And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.",Yes
25162,"First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.",Yes
25163,That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.,Yes
25165,"On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.",No
25166,"These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.",No
25167,"We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.",No
25168,"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''",No
25169,We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.,No
25170,And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.,Yes
25179,"Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.",No
25180,"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.",No
25181,"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''",No
25184,"Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.",No
25185,You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles.,Yes
25186,"There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.",Yes
25188,"Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?",No
25189,"And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?",No
25190,"Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.",No
25191,"And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.",No
25192,You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.,No
25193,"So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.",No
25194,"And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.",No
25195,"The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.",Yes
25197,"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''",No
25198,"But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.",Yes
25199,"So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?",No
25200,"But even after we gave in and said, ""All right, let's discuss it all,'' they walked away from the table.",No
25204,"Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.",No
25205,Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?,No
25207,"And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.",No
25208,"What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.",No
25209,"A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe.",No
25210,"I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.",No
25211,"He said, ""The buck stops here.''",No
25212,"We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.",Yes
25214,"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''",Yes
25216,"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''",Yes
25218,And we know what happened.,No
25219,"After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.",Yes
25220,"This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.",Yes
25224,"Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.",Yes
25225,This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.,Yes
25226,We have an arms race underway instead.,No
25227,A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.,No
25228,Different people with different views fight with each other.,No
25229,"For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.",Yes
25230,And we have this arms race underway.,No
25231,"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control.",Yes
25232,That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.,No
25234,But it takes more than that.,No
25235,You must be tough and smart.,No
25238,This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.,No
25239,"And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.",Yes
25240,It is a question of leadership.,No
25241,"And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.",Yes
25242,Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?,No
25243,And are you prepared to repudiate him now?,No
25244,I read his statement the other day.,No
25245,I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.,No
25247,Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.,No
25248,"I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.",No
25249,But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.,No
25251,And let's talk about people we do control.,No
25252,"In the last debate,1 (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon.",No
25253,"I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.",No
25254,What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?,No
25256,"Mondale was referring to an earlier debate between George Bush and Geraldine Ferarro, the Vice-Presidential candidates.",No
25259,"I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.",No
25260,"And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.",Yes
25261,"Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.",Yes
25262,"When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.",No
25263,"The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.",Yes
25265,"There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight.",No
25266,"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''",No
25267,"The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.",No
25268,"Both said that this administration turned down the ""walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security.",Yes
25269,"When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.",Yes
25270,This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.,No
25271,Now we have a runaway arms race.,No
25272,"All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.",Yes
25273,"They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.",No
25283,"This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.",No
25284,I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.,No
25285,That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.,No
25286,"I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.",No
25288,"We've never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don't think we should have a citizenship card today.",Yes
25290,"I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.",No
25291,"I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.",No
25292,"We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.",No
25293,"Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.",No
25294,"We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.",No
25295,And one of those dreams is justice.,No
25296,And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.,No
25297,The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.,No
25298,We cannot solve this problem all on our own.,No
25299,"And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",Yes
25304,"I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.",Yes
25305,"I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination.",No
25306,This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.,Yes
25307,"And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.",No
25308,"If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.",No
25309,"I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.",No
25310,"And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.",No
25315,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.",Yes
25316,"However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.",No
25317,And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.,No
25318,There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.,No
25319,I can't go into detail about them here.,No
25320,But it is true our borders are out of control.,No
25321,It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.,No
25322,And I supported this bill.,Yes
25323,I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.,No
25324,"With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.",No
25325,We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.,No
25326,"And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.",No
25327,"And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.",No
25328,"But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.",Yes
25329,And we work with those other countries.,No
25336,"As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.",Yes
25337,"As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.",No
25338,"It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.",No
25339,"But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.",No
25340,"And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.",Yes
25341,"And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.",No
25343,"One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.",No
25344,"And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.",No
25345,"And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.",Yes
25346,"These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.",Yes
25347,"And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.",No
25349,"Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.",No
25350,"But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.",Yes
25351,"It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.",Yes
25352,"So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.",No
25362,"Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.",No
25363,"But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.",No
25364,"So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.",Yes
25365,"Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.",No
25366,"But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.",No
25367,And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.,No
25368,"But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.",No
25369,"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?",No
25374,What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?,No
25375,"There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.",Yes
25376,But suppose we came up with that?,No
25377,"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''",No
25378,But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?,No
25379,"Say, ""Look, here's what we can do.",No
25380,We'll even give it to you.,No
25381,"Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''",No
25382,I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.,No
25385,"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.",Yes
25386,"We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.",No
25387,"And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.",No
25388,"And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.",No
25389,I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.,No
25390,"Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?",No
25391,There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.,No
25392,"If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.",No
25393,"But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.",Yes
25394,It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.,No
25395,The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.,No
25399,And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.,No
25400,We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.,No
25401,"If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.",No
25403,"The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.",No
25405,There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.,No
25406,"It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.",No
25407,Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?,No
25413,Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.,No
25414,I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.,No
25415,I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.,No
25416,That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.,No
25417,"Now, why do I support the freeze?",No
25418,Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.,No
25419,It's more difficult to defend this nation.,No
25420,It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.,No
25421,"This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.",No
25422,"We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --",No
25424,#NAME?,No
25426,"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?",No
25427,"Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- ""Here's what we can do.",No
25428,"Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .",No
25432,But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.,No
25433,"I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.",Yes
25434,"And suddenly somebody says, ""Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth.",No
25435,"I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.",No
25437,"Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.",No
25438,"If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space.",No
25439,"[Laughter] If they're antisatellite weapons, I assume they're going to be aimed against satellites.",No
25440,"Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.",No
25441,"The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.",Yes
25442,"And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.",No
25443,"You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.",No
25444,"You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.",Yes
25445,This is an arms escalation.,No
25446,"And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do.",No
25447,"If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.",No
25448,But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.,No
25449,Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?,No
25450,That's what a President's for.,No
25457,"As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.",No
25458,"And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology.",Yes
25459,Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.,No
25461,"It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.",No
25462,"And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.",Yes
25463,The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.,No
25464,"Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.",No
25465,"That's why I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber -- which I've supported for years -- that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated.",No
25466,"In other words, a President has to make choices.",No
25468,The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.,No
25469,Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.,Yes
25470,"We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons.",No
25471,"It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.",No
25472,"Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.",No
25480,"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.",No
25481,Let's take your warhead principle.,No
25482,The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years.,No
25483,"Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.",No
25485,"I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.",No
25486,I don't trust the Russians.,No
25487,"I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.",No
25488,"In other words, we've got to be tough.",No
25489,"But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.",No
25496,"Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.",No
25497,And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.,No
25498,"The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.",Yes
25500,"The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind.",Yes
25501,"But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.",Yes
25502,"The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza.",Yes
25503,"And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.",Yes
25504,"And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.",Yes
25505,"And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.",Yes
25506,Many of them are now the contras.,Yes
25507,"They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some.",Yes
25508,And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.,Yes
25509,"And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?",Yes
25510,It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.,No
25511,They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.,Yes
25512,"And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.",No
25513,"And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.",No
25515,"Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.",No
25516,"And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.",No
25517,And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.,No
25522,Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.,No
25523,"I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.",Yes
25524,What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over?,No
25525,"Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.",No
25526,"What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.",Yes
25528,We need to stand for human rights.,No
25529,We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.,No
25530,National security and human rights must go together.,No
25531,But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.,No
25533,"Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.",Yes
25534,"I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.",No
25535,I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.,No
25536,"I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.",No
25537,Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.,Yes
25538,"And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.",No
25539,"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands.",No
25550,"Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.",No
25551,"And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.",No
25552,"I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.",No
25553,"But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.",No
25554,"But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.",Yes
25555,"I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.",No
25557,"Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?",No
25558,"The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I'm going to ask you to deal with it anyway.",No
25559,"Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?",No
25560,I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.,No
25562,"And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us.",No
25563,"Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.",No
25564,The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.,Yes
25565,"But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.",Yes
25566,"He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.",No
25567,"Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.",No
25568,But why start an arms race now?,No
25570,Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?,No
25571,Why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war?,No
25572,"A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.",No
25573,I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.,No
25574,But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.,No
25575,"He's opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he's failed to do so.",Yes
25576,"And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.",No
25583,"I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.",No
25584,This evening we talked about national strength.,No
25585,"I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.",No
25586,But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.,No
25587,That's key to the strength of our nation.,No
25588,A President must know the essential facts essential to command.,No
25589,But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.,No
25590,"Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.",No
25591,And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.,No
25592,"As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.",No
25593,"That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.",No
25594,"I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front.",No
25595,"I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.",No
25596,America is not temporary; we're forever.,No
25597,"And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.",No
25598,"I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.",No
25599,"And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.",No
25600,"Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.",Yes
25602,This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.,No
25603,I remember the night before I became Vice President.,No
25604,"I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth -- whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species.",No
25605,"That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.",No
25606,A President must know right then.,No
25607,"But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made.",No
25608,And that's why this election is so terribly important.,No
25609,America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.,No
25610,We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth.,No
25611,"When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world.",No
25612,We need to move on.,No
25613,It's time for America to find new leadership.,No
25614,"Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.",No
25617,"My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.",No
25618,"I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for -- an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace.",Yes
25619,"I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely.",No
25620,The question before you comes down to this: Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years?,No
25621,"Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?",No
25622,"We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.",No
25623,The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.,No
25624,"Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter.",No
25625,It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.,No
25626,I remember driving down the California coast one day.,No
25627,My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.,No
25628,"But I couldn't completely neglect the beauty around me -- the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side.",No
25629,"And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.",No
25630,"And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.",No
25631,I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.,No
25632,We know nothing about them.,No
25633,They would know all about our problems.,No
25634,"They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.",No
25635,"They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it.",No
25636,"And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?",No
25637,They will know whether we used those weapons or not.,No
25638,"Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.",No
25639,"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''",No
25640,"You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.",No
25641,"George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had -- George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we've had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience.",No
25642,We have met young America.,No
25643,We have met your sons and daughters.,No
25647,I was just going to -- --,No
25680,"Thank you very much, Jim.",No
25681,Let me first give you a sports update.,No
25682,"The Braves, one; the Cardinals, nothing, early on.",No
25683,I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.,No
25684,"I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.",No
25685,"In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century.",No
25687,"And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?",No
25688,You should know as much as possible about each of us.,No
25689,Sometimes the views have been distorted.,No
25690,There's been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views.,Yes
25691,But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.,No
25692,And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.,No
25693,"Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.",No
25694,"I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans.",No
25695,They live all across the country.,No
25698,"But in any event, I understand the problems.",No
25699,"Whether it's two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it's a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you're worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.",No
25700,This is what this election is all about.,No
25701,And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.,No
25704,"I was going to applaud, too.",No
25706,And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.,No
25707,"Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.",No
25708,"What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.",No
25709,"I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.",No
25710,"Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off.",No
25711,"We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.",Yes
25712,"Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we're putting , 100,000 more police on the street.",Yes
25713,"60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.",Yes
25714,But that progress is only the beginning.,No
25715,What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.,No
25716,I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.,No
25717,Strong families need a strong economy.,No
25718,To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.,No
25719,"We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.",No
25720,We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.,No
25721,We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities.,No
25722,"If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century.",No
25723,That's what I hope to get to talk about tonight.,No
25744,"Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.",No
25745,I appreciate the quote from the young man.,No
25746,There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.,No
25747,They see scandals almost on a daily basis.,No
25748,They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.,No
25749,"They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.",Yes
25750,Nobody knows who hired this man.,Yes
25751,So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.,No
25752,But I've always tried in whatever I've done is to bring people together.,No
25753,I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked.,No
25754,"If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.",No
25755,"I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials.",No
25756,I'm no longer a public official.,No
25757,I left public life on June the 11th of this year.,No
25758,But it is very important.,No
25759,Young people are looking to us.,No
25760,They're looking to us for leadership.,No
25761,"They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver.",No
25762,"And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.",No
25763,"When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word.",No
25764,My word is my bond.,No
25766,"One of the reasons that I ran for president, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way.",No
25767,"And if you remember four years ago, we had not only rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism.",Yes
25768,I had never worked in Washington as an elected official.,Yes
25769,"It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative.",No
25770,"That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility and community.",No
25771,And we've gotten some real progress in the last four years.,No
25772,"I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.",No
25773,We have to respect one another.,No
25774,You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.,No
25775,They were presidents at historic times.,No
25776,This is an historic time.,No
25777,It's important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.,No
25778,"When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country and that's why we're making progress now.",No
25780,"Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.",No
25781,I know you do it.,No
25783,You do a lot of things nobody knows about.,No
25784,I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation.,No
25785,We've raised about $10 million.,Yes
25786,We don't talk about it.,No
25787,We try to help people with disabilities.,No
25788,Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.,No
25789,So it seems to me that there's also a public trust.,No
25790,"When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.",No
25791,"And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.",No
25800,"First of all, let me say what we have done.",No
25801,In the last four years we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality.,No
25802,"The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that's very important.",No
25803,"Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.",Yes
25804,We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick.,Yes
25805,We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they've just had babies.,Yes
25806,"So this is, that's a good start.",No
25807,"In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.",No
25808,"Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.",No
25809,"Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system.",No
25810,"Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months.",No
25811,"That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.",Yes
25812,"Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law.",Yes
25813,"Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.",No
25814,I have heard you say this time after time.,No
25815,"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it.""",No
25816,"You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending.",No
25817,We've always had at least 7 percent.,Yes
25818,You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of inflation.,Yes
25819,We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.,No
25820,It's about where we are now.,No
25821,So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.,No
25822,In my economic plan we increase it 39percent.,Yes
25823,Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.,No
25824,"17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.",Yes
25826,You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.,No
25827,"You're a cardiologist, it wouldn't affect you.",No
25828,"But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.",No
25829,There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill.,No
25830,"We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do.",Yes
25831,We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.,Yes
25832,I don't have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that.,No
25833,But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.,Yes
25835,"On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.",Yes
25836,But the important thing is what are we going to do now?,No
25837,We need to help people who are between jobs.,No
25838,We need to cover more kids.,No
25840,"My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.",Yes
25841,These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.,Yes
25846,"Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.",No
25847,"You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.",Yes
25848,It shouldn't happen in America.,No
25849,We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing.,No
25850,It shouldn't happen in America.,No
25851,And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.,No
25852,"Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.",Yes
25853,"If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.",No
25854,Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.,Yes
25855,Every time you do that you take a risk.,No
25856,"Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.",No
25857,But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.,No
25859,Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam?,No
25860,"That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason.",No
25861,Thank you for doing what you're doing.,No
25862,America owes you a debt of gratitude.,No
25863,May I ask you a question?,No
25864,What service are you in?,No
25866,And what kind of small business do you have?,No
25869,"Let me say, if Senator Dole mentioned this, I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation.",Yes
25870,"I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.",Yes
25871,"I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.",No
25872,"So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.",No
25873,"I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1.",No
25874,We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.,No
25876,We only have ten divisions now.,Yes
25877,We used to have 18.,Yes
25878,We had 25 fighter wings.,Yes
25881,We're down to 336 ships.,Yes
25882,"I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.",Yes
25883,The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion.,No
25884,"He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.",Yes
25885,But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.,No
25891,Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.,No
25892,I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.,Yes
25893,"Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East.",Yes
25894,"The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement -- the peace treaty with Jordan, I was -- I went to Jordan to sign that -- to be there.",Yes
25895,But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.,No
25896,I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.,No
25897,We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.,Yes
25898,I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank.,No
25899,"It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.",No
25900,My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.,No
25901,"You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force -- as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 -- to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it.",No
25902,"I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don't believe that will be the request.",No
25903,I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.,No
25904,That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.,No
25905,"I think they will, and I think we'll get there.",No
25907,"Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget.",No
25908,We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president.,Yes
25909,"He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.",No
25910,We don't have modernization now.,No
25911,"If we don't build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts.",No
25912,We had to make cuts.,No
25913,We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.,Yes
25914,I think we need to go back and take a look.,No
25915,"We're increasing defense reasonably -- not too much, but we are increasing defense some -- because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.",Yes
25916,"I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.",No
25917,"What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.",No
25918,The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.,No
25919,But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.,No
25920,"When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don't want to abandon the peace process.",Yes
25922,Then a lot of mutual distrust developed.,No
25923,A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.,No
25924,"When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.",Yes
25925,"Again, I'd say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond.",No
25926,"It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other, and they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.",No
25927,"Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.",No
25940,"My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.",Yes
25941,They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.,Yes
25942,"In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.",Yes
25943,"We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years.",Yes
25944,"And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.",Yes
25945,So you add it up.,No
25947,Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.,No
25948,My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.,No
25949,I was asked a technical question.,No
25951,Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.,No
25955,"You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.",No
25956,"And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.",Yes
25958,Cocaine use up 160 percent.,Yes
25960,It's all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.,Yes
25961,"When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America.",No
25962,"If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so don't smoke, don't drink, don't use drugs.",No
25964,"Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.",No
25965,We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.,Yes
25966,It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.,No
25967,Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.,No
25968,"Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.",No
25969,That's what drug it out.,No
25970,"Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.",Yes
25971,No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before.,Yes
25974,He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.,No
25975,I think I did the right thing.,No
25976,"On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you.",No
25977,"We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border.",Yes
25978,"We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.",No
25979,"Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.",Yes
25981,"You have a U.S. attorney here that sends `em back home, so I think that's pretty important.",Yes
25982,That's a lot of marijuana.,No
25984,But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.,No
25985,"The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven't done anything on drugs.",No
25986,"I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.",No
25987,"They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.",Yes
25988,"Once it's a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America?",No
25989,"Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.",No
25991,"I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.",No
26001,"First of all, there are two different things.",No
26002,Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities.,Yes
26003,Let's talk about them separately.,No
26004,"Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.",Yes
26005,But we'd like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.,No
26006,"What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.",No
26007,"And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century.",Yes
26008,And we will do that.,No
26009,"It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.",No
26012,I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.,No
26013,That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.,Yes
26014,"It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide.",No
26015,Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.,No
26016,"But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.",No
26017,"Well again, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be -- we'll work it out.",No
26018,"This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.",No
26019,"After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.",Yes
26021,"Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat.",No
26022,They appointed a commission I was on that commission.,No
26023,"We resolved, we rescued Social Security.",Yes
26024,"We suggested -- I think it has been over a year ago now -- we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick.",Yes
26025,Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission.,Yes
26026,It will probably have to be done by a commission.,No
26027,Take it out of politics.,No
26028,"I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.",No
26029,"When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.",No
26030,We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.,No
26031,Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year.,Yes
26032,Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.,Yes
26033,Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.,Yes
26034,"Not in an election year, sir.",No
26035,I told them in early '95.,No
26036,Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.,Yes
26037,"A year ago he said, ""I was right then.",No
26038,"I knew it wouldn't work.""",No
26040,We need to reform it.,No
26048,"Well, we've taken the first step.",No
26049,"Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.",Yes
26050,"On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.",Yes
26051,What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.,No
26052,"And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.",No
26053,And three of those checks were my grandparents'.,No
26054,So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.,No
26055,Obviously some people are going to need help.,No
26056,This is the United States of America.,No
26057,You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.,No
26059,"But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.",No
26060,We're going to say you have a five-year limit.,No
26061,You can be on welfare.,No
26062,You got two years to look for a job.,No
26063,"We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill.",Yes
26064,But this is an important issue.,No
26065,I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.,No
26066,It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.,No
26067,It puts a heavy burden on a states like California.,Yes
26068,It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.,Yes
26070,Let me get out of your way here.,No
26071,It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.,Yes
26072,Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.,No
26073,I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.,Yes
26074,So I've been working on it when I was a governor for a long time.,Yes
26075,When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work.,Yes
26077,"Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.",No
26079,And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.,No
26080,There's not a more important issue.,No
26081,"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?""",No
26082,I met that woman again.,No
26084,"One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.",No
26085,"One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.",No
26086,"I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so I've got a plan to do it, and it's just beginning.",No
26087,Well another thing we can do.,No
26089,We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.,No
26092,$500 per child under 18.,Yes
26093,Reduce the capital gains rate.,No
26094,Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.,No
26097,"The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president.",Yes
26098,"The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them.",Yes
26099,"We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector.",No
26100,The president takes credit for all these people off welfare.,No
26102,Federal government doesn't do that.,No
26103,And the government doesn't create jobs.,No
26104,They're created in the private sector.,No
26112,"First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.",No
26113,"Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.",Yes
26114,We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.,Yes
26115,It was part of our other economic plan.,No
26116,And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.,No
26117,"I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.",No
26118,One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.,Yes
26119,We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.,Yes
26120,We've got this country going in the right direction.,No
26121,So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs.,No
26122,"So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about.",No
26125,"Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.",Yes
26127,"You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.",No
26128,So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.,Yes
26129,"We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.",Yes
26130,"And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you.",No
26131,"But in any event, no tax.",No
26132,"It's a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it's only temporary.",No
26133,"Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.",No
26135,"Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent.",No
26136,There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.,Yes
26137,"If we cut the capital gains rate, I'm told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can't, because the capital gains rate's too high.",Yes
26141,That'll help people who want to get off welfare.,No
26143,"Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.",Yes
26144,We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.,No
26146,"After he left the senate, we abandoned that.",No
26147,"That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.",Yes
26148,"That's why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.",No
26149,You should expect that from both of us.,No
26160,"Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.",No
26161,"And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.",No
26162,I think it also is a strength.,No
26164,"And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign.",No
26166,"This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.",No
26167,"It's one America, one nation.",No
26168,I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.,No
26170,The president has been AWOL for four years.,No
26172,"He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down.",Yes
26173,"Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City.",Yes
26174,Of course the president will take credit for that.,No
26175,My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.,No
26176,"This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.",Yes
26179,"6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.",Yes
26180,We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant.,Yes
26181,"In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.",Yes
26182,I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.,No
26183,It's the age of his ideas that I question.,No
26184,You're almost not old enough to remember this.,No
26185,"But we tried this before, promising people an election year tax cut that's not paid for.",Yes
26186,You tried it last time you ran.,Yes
26187,Tell him you can have everything you got.,No
26188,And so let me just say this.,No
26189,Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?,Yes
26190,They did after he left.,Yes
26191,"The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.",Yes
26192,I vetoed it when they shut the government down.,No
26193,My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.,No
26194,"A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition.",No
26195,"We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.",No
26196,My whole administration is about your future.,No
26197,It's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you.,No
26198,I hope you will look at the ideas in it.,No
26200,"When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.",No
26201,"As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.",No
26202,Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.,No
26204,"That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.",No
26205,President Clinton came to California in 1992.,No
26206,He said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut.,No
26207,"Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations.",No
26208,Because you got a big tax increase.,Yes
26209,You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.,Yes
26210,And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.,No
26211,Well he made the promise.,No
26212,"I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut.",No
26213,It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.,No
26222,I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.,No
26223,"But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.",No
26224,"I've done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn't think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action's been around.",Yes
26225,But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.,No
26226,Let me just give you some examples.,No
26227,"We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.",Yes
26229,But the joint chiefs say we're stronger and more confident and solid than ever.,Yes
26230,Let me give you another example of what I mean.,No
26231,"To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.",No
26232,"It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs.",Yes
26233,"We weren't guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.",No
26234,And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.,No
26235,"We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land.",No
26237,"Well, we may not be there yet but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas.",No
26238,I supported that route for some time and again I think it gets back to experience.,No
26239,"A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.",No
26240,And I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top.,No
26241,The average person wasn't benefitting.,No
26242,People who had the money were benefiting.,No
26243,People who got all the jobs were benefiting.,No
26244,It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.,No
26245,It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.,No
26248,I shouldn't have a preference.,No
26249,"I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.",No
26250,Maybe we can work that out.,No
26251,I get a 10-point spot.,No
26254,Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.,No
26255,"We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.",No
26257,But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.,No
26258,That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.,No
26259,I have never supported quotas.,Yes
26260,I've always been against them.,Yes
26261,"I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.",No
26262,The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.,No
26263,"Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.",No
26264,Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up.,No
26265,You don't guarantee they get the job.,No
26266,You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.,No
26267,"And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me.",No
26268,"General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs.",No
26269,"No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified.",No
26276,Well I'm glad you asked.,No
26279,"I first want to say the President didn't quite give you all of the stuff on the quotas, because the Justice Department had what we called the Piscataway case up in New Jersey.",Yes
26280,"It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.",No
26281,It shouldn't be that way.,No
26282,"Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it.",No
26283,There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.,Yes
26285,"Now, this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or -- you know, estate tax relief which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction.",No
26286,"If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.",Yes
26287,We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.,No
26288,How do we pay for it?,No
26289,"You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.",Yes
26290,He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.,No
26291,"We're going to balance the budget, by the year 2002.",No
26292,"The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.",Yes
26293,"Remember, it's your money; it's not his money.",No
26294,And it's not my money.,No
26296,And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.,No
26297,But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.,No
26298,"He wants to give you sort of a government tax cut, which really doesn't mean anything.",No
26299,"You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's true.",No
26300,"When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.",Yes
26303,"They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities.",Yes
26304,Don't take my word for this.,No
26305,"The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education.",Yes
26306,It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time.,Yes
26307,"My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs.",No
26308,"And it's paid for, and I'll tell you how I'll pay for it.",No
26309,He won't tell you because he can't.,No
26310,"Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody.",No
26311,That's the problem with it.,No
26313,"But I must say I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme.""",No
26314,"You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg.",No
26315,"If I have anything in politics, it's my word.",No
26316,"My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word.",No
26317,I'm going to keep my word to you.,No
26318,I'm going to keep my word to the American people.,No
26319,We're going to tax -- cut taxes and balance the budget.,No
26320,We're not going to touch Medicare.,No
26321,"It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.",No
26322,The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.,No
26323,This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.,No
26324,"He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.",No
26330,"Thank you, well, first let me say that I signed the Family Leave Act.",No
26331,"It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.",No
26332,"I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.",No
26333,Most important good things that happen in America happen in families.,No
26334,"Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children.",No
26335,Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.,Yes
26336,I'd like to see it expanded in two ways.,No
26337,I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.,No
26338,"I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.",No
26339,"I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law.",No
26340,"In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer.",No
26341,"One of the people who's here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law.",No
26342,"So yes, I think it should be expanded.",No
26343,We have to help people succeed at home and at work.,No
26345,We had a better idea.,No
26347,We had a better idea.,No
26348,Now we have a majority and we get a president.,No
26349,That was a tax credit for the employer.,No
26350,"Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.",No
26351,"This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.",No
26352,"But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.",Yes
26353,"And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.",Yes
26354,"We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.",No

26422,We're selling everything from from -- from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan.,Yes
26423,We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.,Yes
26424,I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.,No
26425,"We're No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s.",Yes
26427,"Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.",Yes
26428,"We have a good, stable economic policy.",No
26429,Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.,Yes
26430,"For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.",Yes
26431,More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.,Yes
26432,"You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.",No
26434,Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.,No
26437,They're setting new records this year.,No
26438,We had the worst economy in a century.,Yes
26439,"We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent.",Yes
26440,The president inherited growth of over 5 percent.,Yes
26441,We don't have the S&L crisis anymore.,Yes
26442,"Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending, that's why the budget looked good.",Yes
26443,It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.,No
26451,"I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination.",No
26453,"Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.",No
26454,Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.,No
26455,"In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.",Yes
26456,And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.,No
26458,I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.,No
26459,But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.,No
26460,"No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet.",No
26461,No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person.,No
26462,"Now, for four years that's what I worked on.",No
26463,"If you give me four years more I will work on it some more and I will try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future and I gave you a direct answer.",No
26465,"Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.",No
26466,That would be my answer to this question.,No
26467,"And I'm, you know -- there would be special rights for different groups in America.",No
26468,But I'm totally opposed to discrimination.,No
26469,"I don't have any policy against hiring anyone; whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future.",Yes
26470,"But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night.",No
26472,"But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.",No
26473,If there's anything that's going to change America it's get the economy growing.,No
26474,"The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets.",Yes
26475,Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it's the best four years ever.,No
26477,"We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.",Yes
26478,Credit card debt has never been higher.,Yes
26479,I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.,No
26480,"We need a good strong economic package, let the private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.",No
26481,"If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole.",Yes
26482,I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.,No
26483,Let me just give you one tiny example.,No
26484,"In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.",Yes
26485,And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.,Yes
26486,That's just one tiny example.,No
26487,Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.,No
26500,"Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.",Yes
26501,Everybody would have been forced into managed care.,No
26502,You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.,No
26503,And I think right now we got to go back.,No
26504,I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.,No
26505,Maybe that's part of the answer.,No
26506,"But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.",No
26507,We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.,No
26508,That's why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.,Yes
26510,"And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.",Yes
26511,"It was a big, big mistake.",No
26512,"Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.",No
26514,I hope not in both cases.,No
26515,But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.,No
26516,You're going to have to watch it.,No
26517,"Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.",No
26519,How many of you are under managed care plans?,No
26520,Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.,No
26521,How many of you like it?,No
26523,"Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.",Yes
26524,Now that's not a government takeover.,No
26525,That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.,No
26526,I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.,No
26527,"In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.",No
26528,"If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.",No
26529,"If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.",No
26530,"A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.",No
26532,"Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.",No
26533,I think that would help.,No
26534,But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.,Yes
26535,"If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.",No
26536,"17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.",Yes
26537,We'd have that trouble all over America.,No
26538,We need to deal with managed care.,No
26539,It not only happened in California.,Yes
26540,"It's happening in other states that we visit, too.",No
26542,Not just a state problem.,No
26552,"First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.",No
26553,That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law.,Yes
26554,There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it.,Yes
26555,"Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.",No
26556,You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.,Yes
26557,A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.,No
26558,"Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.",No
26559,"Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.",No
26560,"And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here.",No
26561,"For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question.",No
26562,So I think we have to change the nature of politics.,No
26563,"The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.",Yes
26565,"Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.",No
26566,"I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote.",No
26567,"And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.",No
26568,"People say, ""I don't care.",No
26569,"One vote doesn't make a difference.""",No
26570,I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.,No
26571,I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.,No
26573,"It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000.",No
26574,But maybe there ought to be more debates.,No
26575,I would be willing to have another debate this year.,No
26576,We can invite all the candidates.,No
26577,And talk about the economy.,No
26578,"If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.",No
26579,If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.,No
26580,It's going to help jobs.,No
26581,It's going to help everything.,No
26582,"Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.",No
26583,One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.,No
26584,And there is a connection.,No
26585,"And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.",No
26586,If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave.,No
26587,"If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it.",No
26588,But these are important questions.,No
26589,And people have to decide.,No
26590,I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.,No
26599,"Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.",No
26600,You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.,Yes
26601,"We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.",No
26602,Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.,No
26603,You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.,No
26604,It's something you might consider.,No
26605,"I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.",No
26606,"It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.",No
26607,And we didn't touch it.,No
26610,Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire.,No
26612,It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.,No
26613,In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.,Yes
26615,"Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.",Yes
26616,So we need to preserve the system.,No
26617,And we need to make it stronger.,No
26618,"But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.",No
26619,"In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress.",Yes
26620,"so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.",No
26621,"Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.",No
26622,Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.,Yes
26623,"And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.",No
26624,"So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.",Yes
26625,"So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.",No
26626,"In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.",No
26627,My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.,Yes
26628,Now none of that will happen anymore.,No
26629,"I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.",No
26630,Did you say you're unemployed?,No
26632,"See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.",No
26633,And that's the economic package again.,No
26635,Reduce the capital gains rate.,No
26637,Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.,No
26638,And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.,No
26639,"Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.",No
26640,"Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.",No
26641,We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.,No
26642,We took it out of politics.,No
26643,people get so tired of politics.,No
26644,We ought to do the same with Medicare.,No
26645,Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.,No
26654,Let me tell you what we have done.,No
26655,We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.,Yes
26656,"And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.",Yes
26657,Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.,Yes
26658,"It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.",No
26659,But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.,No
26660,We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.,Yes
26661,I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.,No
26662,"I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.",Yes
26663,There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.,No
26664,"You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.",No
26665,"We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive.",No
26666,"We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.",No
26667,"Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.",No
26668,"There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost.",Yes
26669,And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.,No
26670,We didn't have access to their markets.,Yes
26671,We ought to insist on access.,No
26672,"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough.",No
26674,"When you give us access, we'll give you access.""",No
26675,"It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.",No
26676,They want to get into our market.,Yes
26677,"They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.",No
26678,"And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.",No
26679,I supported the President's trade policy.,Yes
26680,But we got to be more aggressive.,No
26681,"Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.",No
26682,There are American jobs that are being lost.,No
26683,This is what Ross Perot complains about.,No
26684,"And I'd say to the Reform party, take a look at the Republican party.",No
26685,"We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better, and one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs.",No
26686,"Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.",Yes
26687,"By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.",Yes
26688,And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.,No
26689,"We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.",Yes
26690,"So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.",Yes
26691,There is not a simple answer.,No
26692,"You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.",No
26693,I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.,No
26701,"Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.",No
26702,"In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., that'd in effect confiscate your property, so -- I carry it in my pocket -- I can't pull it out or I'd violate the rules -- a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here.",No
26703,You ought to make more decisions.,No
26704,"Honor, duty, and country, that's what America is all about.",No
26705,"Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.",No
26708,"And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.",No
26709,"And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.",Yes
26710,This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.,No
26712,"When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.",Yes
26713,There are 900 sequestered in the White House.,Yes
26716,Why should they be rifling through your files?,No
26717,The president has a great responsibility.,No
26718,That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.,No
26719,"This is the most religious, great country in history.",No
26720,"And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe.",No
26721,"And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children.",Yes
26722,Let me very briefly give you some examples.,No
26723,"One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.",No
26724,"So I changed the Justice Department's effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe, because he was bankrupt when he gave it.",Yes
26725,"I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs.",No
26726,"I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to.",Yes
26727,"That is the kind of thing we have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.",No
26728,"I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.",No
26729,"Because it's God's will, whatever happens.",No
26730,"It's God's will, it'll happen.",No
26731,"The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.",No
26732,I support it; the president opposes it.,No
26733,"It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.",No
26734,People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.,No
26735,"And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.",No
26747,"I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.",No
26748,"We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone who's experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.",Yes
26749,"Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.",No
26750,It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.,No
26751,"I would wind up -- I mean, it's the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.",No
26752,Let me tell you what I feel.,No
26753,"We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.",No
26754,"But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.",No
26755,That's the way the system works.,No
26756,"All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences.",No
26757,We still have some of that hatred inside us.,No
26758,You see it in the church burnings.,No
26759,"And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.",No
26761,"Well, I hope I made my answer clear.",No
26762,I said I'm opposed to discrimination.,No
26763,You know we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.,No
26764,There are 43 million of us.,Yes
26765,And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.,No
26766,So we want to end discrimination.,No
26767,I think that answers itself.,No
26770,And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.,No
26771,"We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.",No
26773,And we're all proud of it.,No
26774,But we're not there yet.,No
26775,"What we need is good, strong leadership going in the next century.",No
26776,"I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, ""Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.""",No
26777,Now that was quite an admission.,No
26778,"It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration.",No
26779,"It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.",No
26780,"Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.",No
26781,"Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.",No
26782,And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.,No
26783,And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of ad hominem way.,No
26787,"We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.",No
26788,The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.,No
26793,"Well, let me thank everybody here at the University and, Jim, thank you.",No
26795,This is what it's all about.,No
26797,It's not about President Clinton.,No
26799,It's about selecting a president of the United States.,No
26800,So we have our differences.,No
26801,We should have our differences.,No
26804,We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.,No
26805,We should have more debates.,No
26806,Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.,No
26807,But I would just say this.,No
26808,"This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed.",No
26809,"Somebody who understands that there're real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.",No
26810,There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.,No
26811,"President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.",Yes
26812,President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment.,Yes
26813,Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.,Yes
26815,Couple of service men here.,No
26816,"They sacrifice, they give everything for America.",No
26817,We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.,No
26818,But beyond that we need to address the economy.,No
26819,I will just say my time is running out here.,No
26820,It's a very proud moment for me.,No
26821,What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.,No
26822,And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.,No
26823,Proud that they voted for the right candidate.,No
26824,Proud that they voted hopefully for me.,No
26825,"And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.",No
26826,Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good.,No
26828,I promise you the economy is going to get better.,No
26830,We're going into the next century a better America.,No
26833,"And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.",No
26834,One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said.,No
26835,"It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president.",No
26836,Could have a chance to serve as president.,No
26837,First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president.,No
26838,This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century.,No
26839,"Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?",No
26840,Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself?,No
26841,"If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this.",No
26842,This is a real important election.,No
26843,"The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes.",No
26844,And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.,No
26845,So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.,No
26846,"I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.",No
26847,Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th.,No
26848,"Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",No
26849,"You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police.",No
26850,Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.,No
26851,Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.,No
26852,Whether we're going to give our children a world-class education.,No
26853,Where every eight-year-old can read.,No
26854,Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet.,No
26855,Every 18-year-old can go to college.,No
26856,If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.,No
26902,And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.,No
26903,Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.,No
26904,"And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.",No
26905,"We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose.",No
26907,"This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a -- a complete change in the -- the structure and the -- the environment in the Middle East.",No
26908,"With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.",No
26909,"But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.",No
26910,"Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.",Yes
26911,"We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.",Yes
26912,Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.,No
26913,"Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.",Yes
26914,"We have in -- in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president.",Yes
26915,And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.,No
26916,"Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.",No
26917,And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.,No
26918,I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.,No
26919,But we can't kill our way out of this mess.,No
26920,"We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the -- the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is -- it's certainly not on the run.",No
26922,"This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.",Yes
26924,"Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.",No
26925,And that's what we've done over the last four years.,No
26926,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.",No
26927,"And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.",Yes
26928,"In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.",No
26929,And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.,No
26930,"Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.",Yes
26931,And that's exactly what we're going to do.,No
26932,But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.,No
26933,"Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.",Yes
26934,"Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.",Yes
26936,Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.,No
26937,"And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.",No
26938,"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.",No
26939,But my strategy is broader than that.,No
26940,"That's -- that's important, of course.",No
26941,But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.,No
26942,"We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.",No
26943,That's not the right course for us.,No
26944,"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.",No
26945,And how do we do that?,No
26946,"A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the -- the world reject these -- these terrorists.",No
26947,And the answer they came up with was this:,No
26949,"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.",No
26952,"Number four, the rule of law.",No
26953,We have to help these nations create civil societies.,No
26954,"But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.",Yes
26955,And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.,No
26956,"It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.",No
26957,"But next door, of course, we have Egypt.",No
26958,"Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.",Yes
26959,We want -- we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.,No
26960,"With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.",Yes
26961,"And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).",Yes
26963,"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.",Yes
26964,"But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.",No
26965,You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.,No
26966,"But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.",Yes
26967,"And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.",No
26968,"You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.",Yes
26969,You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.,Yes
26970,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.",Yes
26971,"You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.",Yes
26972,Then you said we should.,No
26973,"Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.",No
26974,"So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.",No
26975,"And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.",No
26977,"Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.",No
26978,They don't happen to be accurate.,No
26979,"But -- but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and -- and confusion.",No
26980,And -- and attacking me is not an agenda.,No
26981,"Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.",No
26983,"First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe.",Yes
26987,"It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.",Yes
26988,Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.,Yes
26989,I have clear eyes on this.,No
26990,"I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.",No
26991,"And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.",No
26992,"After the election, he'll get more backbone.",No
26993,"Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.",No
26996,You didn't want a status of...,No
26997,"What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.",Yes
26998,And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.,No
26999,"I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.",Yes
27000,That was something I concurred with...,Yes
27005,That was my posture as well.,No
27006,"You thought it should have been 5,000 troops...",Yes
27010,"I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?",No
27011,The answer was we got...,No
27013,... no troops through whatsoever.,Yes
27014,This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.,Yes
27020,...that's a -- I indicated...,No
27024,...I indicated that you failed to put in place a status...,No
27028,...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.,No
27029,Governor -- here -- here's -- here's one thing...,No
27031,...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.,No
27034,"You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.",No
27035,You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.,Yes
27036,That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.,No
27037,"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.",No
27038,"And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.",No
27039,"Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.",No
27040,"Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.",No
27041,"Number four, we do have to develop their economic -- their economic capabilities.",No
27042,"But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.",No
27043,Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.,No
27044,That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.,No
27057,"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.",Yes
27058,We've mobilized sanctions against that government.,Yes
27059,We have made sure that they are isolated.,No
27060,"We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.",Yes
27061,"But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.",No
27062,"And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.",Yes
27063,"This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.",No
27064,"But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.",No
27065,And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.,No
27066,"But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.",Yes
27068,"Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.",No
27069,"First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.",Yes
27070,"Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.",No
27071,Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.,Yes
27072,It's their route to the sea.,No
27073,"It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.",No
27074,And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.,No
27075,"Number two, seeing a -- a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.",No
27076,"And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.",Yes
27077,We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.,No
27078,"And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a -- in a form of -- if not government, a form of -- of -- of council that can take the lead in Syria.",No
27079,And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.,No
27080,We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.,No
27081,Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.,No
27082,"We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with -- with Israel.",No
27083,"But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.",No
27084,They're willing to work with us.,Yes
27085,"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.",No
27086,Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.,No
27087,I believe he will go.,No
27088,"But I believe -- we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a -- as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.",No
27089,This -- this is a critical opportunity for America.,No
27090,"And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.",No
27091,"And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.",No
27093,"Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.",No
27097,We are playing the leadership role.,No
27098,We organized the Friends of Syria.,No
27099,"We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition.",Yes
27101,But going back to Libya -- because this is an example of how we make choices.,No
27102,"When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.",Yes
27103,We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.,No
27104,"And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.",Yes
27105,"But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.",Yes
27108,And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.,No
27109,That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.,No
27110,"But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.",No
27111,That's exactly what we're doing.,No
27113,I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.,No
27114,I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.,No
27115,I don't anticipate that in the future.,No
27116,"As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible.",Yes
27117,"And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove -- to remove Assad.",No
27118,But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.,No
27120,And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.,No
27121,"We -- we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.",Yes
27122,"But look, this has been going on for a year.",Yes
27123,This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.,No
27124,"We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.",No
27125,"As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.",No
27127,"They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.",No
27129,America can help that happen.,No
27130,And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.,No
27133,"Well, I'll -- I'll be very quick.",No
27134,What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.,No
27135,And that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a -- an effective transition so that we get Assad out.,No
27136,That's the kind of leadership we've shown.,No
27137,That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.,No
27142,"No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.",No
27143,"The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.",No
27144,"But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities.",Yes
27145,"And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.",Yes
27146,These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.,No
27147,They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.,No
27148,"That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.",No
27149,They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.,No
27150,"And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.",No
27151,Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.,No
27152,"They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.",No
27153,They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.,No
27154,"And so one of the things that we've been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent.",Yes
27155,"But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.",No
27156,"You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.",No
27157,And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do...,No
27160,"I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.",No
27162,"I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did.",No
27163,"But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.",No
27164,"Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.",No
27165,We want a peaceful planet.,No
27166,"We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.",No
27168,And the mantle of leadership for the -- promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.,No
27169,We didn't ask for it.,No
27170,But it's an honor that we have it.,No
27171,But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.,No
27172,And that begins with a strong economy here at home.,No
27173,"Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.",No
27175,Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.,Yes
27176,This -- we have weakened our economy.,Yes
27177,We need a strong economy.,No
27178,We need to have as well a strong military.,No
27179,Our military is second to none in the world.,Yes
27180,"We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence.",No
27181,But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.,Yes
27182,We need to have strong allies.,No
27183,Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.,No
27184,"We're the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.",Yes
27186,"And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.",No
27187,"But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence will grow.",No
27188,"But unfortunately, in -- nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago.",Yes
27190,And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four...,No
27195,"Well I -- I absolutely believe that America has a -- a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that -- that make the world more peaceful.",No
27196,"And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.",Yes
27197,"Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.",No
27198,They don't vote for war.,No
27199,So we want to promote those principles around the world.,No
27200,We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.,No
27201,We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.,No
27202,"But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.",No
27204,"And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.",No
27205,You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.,No
27206,You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.,No
27207,"You can't have kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.",Yes
27208,We have to get our economy going.,No
27209,"And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.",No
27210,We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.,No
27211,We -- we make decisions today in the military that -- that will confront challenges we can't imagine.,No
27212,"In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.",Yes
27213,"And a year later, 9/11 happened.",Yes
27214,"So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.",No
27215,I will not cut our military budget.,No
27216,We have to also stand by our allies.,No
27217,I -- I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.,No
27218,"I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.",No
27219,"And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when -- when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.",No
27220,"We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.",No
27222,America remains the one indispensable nation.,No
27223,"And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.",No
27224,"Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.",No
27225,It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.,No
27226,"And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.",Yes
27227,"But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does.",Yes
27228,"Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.",Yes
27229,"Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.",No
27230,Doing everything we can to control our own energy.,No
27231,We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.,Yes
27232,But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.,No
27233,That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.,No
27234,And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.,No
27235,"Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.",No
27236,"We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.",No
27237,That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.,No
27238,"Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.",No
27239,"Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.",No
27240,He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's -- who shows great wisdom and judgment.,No
27241,And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.,No
27243,I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future.,No
27244,"And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.",No
27245,And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.,No
27246,The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.,Yes
27247,We're 9 million jobs short of that.,Yes
27248,"I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.",No
27249,"Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence.",No
27250,"We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.",No
27251,"Number two, we're going to increase our trade.",No
27252,Trade grows about 12 percent year.,Yes
27253,It doubles about every -- every five or so years.,Yes
27254,"We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.",No
27255,The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.,No
27256,"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.",Yes
27257,We're all focused on China.,No
27258,"Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.",No
27259,"Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.",No
27260,And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.,No
27261,We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.,No
27262,And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.,No
27263,And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.,No
27264,"And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.",No
27265,Small business is where jobs come from.,No
27266,Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.,Yes
27267,New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.,Yes
27268,I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.,No
27269,"Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.",No
27270,"First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses.",No
27271,"But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.",Yes
27272,And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.,No
27273,And they include you and me.,No
27274,That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.,No
27275,But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that's our education policy.,No
27276,We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.,No
27277,"You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.",Yes
27278,We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.,No
27279,And they're starting to finally make progress.,No
27280,"And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.",No
27281,And those teachers can make a difference.,No
27282,"Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow.",Yes
27283,"When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.",No
27284,"But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.",No
27285,"And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.",No
27286,Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.,No
27287,"And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.",No
27288,"That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices.",No
27292,"Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...",No
27294,"... if you'll let me, Bob, just about education...",No
27296,... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.,No
27297,We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing.,No
27298,Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.,No
27299,"While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math.",Yes
27300,And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.,Yes
27301,First time one state had been number one in all four measures.,Yes
27302,How did we do that?,No
27303,"Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.",No
27305,And that was -- that was -- that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.,Yes
27306,But that was 10 years before you took office.,Yes
27308,And then you cut education spending when you came into office.,Yes
27309,The first -- the first -- the first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation.,Yes
27310,They're still number one today.,Yes
27312,"And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to -- to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.",Yes
27313,That happened before you came into office.,No
27315,"That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.",No
27316,You got that fact wrong.,Yes
27324,"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.",No
27325,"First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.",No
27329,The good news is (inaudible).,No
27330,I'd be happy to have you take a look.,No
27332,You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.,No
27333,We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.,No
27334,"By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.",No
27335,"There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.",No
27336,And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.,No
27337,So I'd get rid of that one from day one.,No
27338,"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.",No
27339,"We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.",No
27340,"Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.",Yes
27341,"As a governor, I thought please, give me this program.",No
27342,"I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.",No
27343,"States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.",Yes
27344,I want to do those two things and get this -- get this to a balanced budget with eight -- eight to 10 years.,No
27345,"But the military -- let's get back to the military, though.",No
27349,He should have answered the first question.,No
27350,"Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.",Yes
27351,"Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.",Yes
27352,He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.,Yes
27353,"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.",Yes
27354,"We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.",Yes
27356,"And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?",No
27357,And that's the budget that we've put forward.,No
27358,"But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts.",Yes
27359,"You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are.",No
27360,And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.,No
27361,The math simply doesn't work.,Yes
27362,"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities.",No
27363,We need to be thinking about cyber security.,No
27364,We need to be talking about space.,No
27365,"That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.",No
27366,It's not driven by politics.,Yes
27367,"It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see.",No
27368,"It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?",No
27369,"That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.",Yes
27370,Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.,No
27371,I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.,No
27372,I was on the world of business for 25 years.,No
27373,"If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.",No
27374,"I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.",No
27375,I had the chance to be governor of a state.,No
27376,"Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.",No
27377,We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.,Yes
27378,The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.,Yes
27379,I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.,No
27381,I'm going to be able to balance the budget.,No
27382,"Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.",No
27386,The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.,Yes
27387,We're now at under 285.,Yes
27388,We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.,No
27390,I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.,No
27392,We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.,Yes
27393,Now we're changing to one conflict.,Yes
27394,"Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.",No
27395,"And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.",Yes
27396,"That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.",No
27397,"Bob, I just need to comment on this.",No
27398,"First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.",No
27399,It is something that Congress has proposed.,No
27401,The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.,Yes
27404,"You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.",Yes
27405,"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.",No
27406,"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.",No
27407,"We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.",No
27408,"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.",No
27409,It's what are our capabilities.,No
27410,"And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.",No
27411,And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.,No
27413,"And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work.",No
27420,"First of all, Israel is a true friend.",Yes
27421,It is our greatest ally in the region.,No
27422,"And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.",No
27423,I've made that clear throughout my presidency.,No
27426,I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.,No
27427,"And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.",Yes
27428,"In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.",Yes
27429,"But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.",Yes
27430,I made that clear when I came into office.,Yes
27431,"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.",Yes
27432,Their currency has dropped 80 percent.,Yes
27433,Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.,Yes
27434,So their economy is in a shambles.,Yes
27435,"And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.",No
27436,We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.,No
27437,Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.,Yes
27438,"And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.",No
27439,And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.,Yes
27440,So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.,Yes
27441,"They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.",No
27442,"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.",Yes
27443,"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.",No
27445,"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.",No
27446,"And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.",No
27448,"Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.",No
27449,"It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.",No
27450,"It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.",Yes
27451,"And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.",Yes
27452,"I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.",No
27454,You're seeing it right now in the economy.,Yes
27455,"It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.",No
27456,I would have put them in place earlier.,No
27457,But it's good that we have them.,No
27458,"Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.",No
27459,"I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.",No
27461,would agree with us as well.,No
27462,"Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.",No
27463,I would tighten those sanctions further.,No
27464,"Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.",No
27465,I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.,Yes
27466,His words amount to genocide incitation.,No
27467,I would indict him for it.,No
27468,I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.,No
27469,The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.,No
27470,"We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.",No
27471,"And of course, a military action is the last resort.",No
27472,It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.,No
27476,"Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.",No
27478,But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.,No
27479,"Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.",No
27480,There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.,No
27481,"And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.",No
27483,And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.,No
27484,"You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference.",No
27485,And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.,No
27487,We started from the day we got into office.,No
27488,"And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.",No
27489,Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.,No
27490,It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.,No
27491,And we've got to maintain that pressure.,No
27492,"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.",No
27493,They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.,No
27494,There are inspections that are very intrusive.,No
27495,"But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.",No
27496,"In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.",No
27497,And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.,No
27499,We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.,No
27500,And I've been very clear to them.,No
27501,"You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.",Yes
27502,And that clock is ticking.,No
27505,"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.",No
27506,I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.,No
27507,"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.",Yes
27508,"And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.",No
27509,"And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.",Yes
27510,I think they looked at that and saw weakness.,No
27511,"Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.",No
27512,I think they noticed that as well.,No
27513,"And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.",No
27514,"All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.",No
27515,"Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.",Yes
27516,"That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.",No
27517,And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.,No
27518,They must not develop nuclear capability.,No
27520,They need to be tightened.,No
27521,Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.,No
27522,We need to indict Ahmadinejad.,No
27523,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.",No
27524,"Bob, let me just respond.",No
27525,"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.",No
27526,This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.,No
27527,"And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.",Yes
27528,"And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.",Yes
27529,"And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.",Yes
27530,"So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.",No
27531,"And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.",Yes
27532,And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.,No
27533,"When I came into office, the world was divided.",No
27535,"Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.",Yes
27536,And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.,No
27537,That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.,Yes
27538,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,Yes
27539,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,Yes
27540,And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.,No
27542,"Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.",No
27543,"And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.",Yes
27544,"And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.",No
27545,"And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.",No
27546,You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.,No
27547,"Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.",No
27548,We have freed other nations from dictators.,Yes
27549,"Bob, let me -- let me respond.",No
27550,"If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.",No
27551,"And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.",Yes
27553,"I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.",No
27554,"And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.",No
27555,And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms.,No
27556,And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.,No
27557,"Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.",Yes
27558,"So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.",No
27559,And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?,No
27560,"And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.",No
27561,And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.,No
27562,And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.,No
27566,"Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.",No
27567,"Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.",No
27568,This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of --,No
27573,But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.,No
27574,"Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.",No
27575,"Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.",No
27576,"I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.",No
27577,"I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.",Yes
27579,"I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.",Yes
27580,"I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.",Yes
27581,"I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.",Yes
27582,They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.,Yes
27583,"I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.",No
27584,"I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.",No
27585,"I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.",Yes
27586,"They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...",No
27588,... the damage in his -- in his own party.,No
27589,"Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.",No
27590,"I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.",No
27591,But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.,Yes
27592,"In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.",Yes
27593,"In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.",Yes
27594,The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.,No
27595,"When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.",Yes
27596,"But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.",Yes
27597,And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.,No
27598,"And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.",No
27599,And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.,No
27600,"You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.",No
27601,"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you.""",No
27602,"And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.",No
27603,"And she said to me, ""You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.""",No
27604,"And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.",No
27605,"And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.",No
27606,Those decisions generally -- generally are not poll-tested.,No
27607,"And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.",No
27608,"But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.",No
27613,You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.,No
27622,"Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.",No
27623,The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.,No
27624,We've seen progress over the past several years.,Yes
27625,The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.,Yes
27626,"There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.",Yes
27627,So our troops will come home at that point.,Yes
27628,"I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.",No
27629,And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.,No
27630,"And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.",No
27631,"But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.",Yes
27632,They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.,No
27633,They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.,Yes
27634,"And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.",No
27635,And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.,No
27636,And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.,No
27637,"So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.",No
27639,"When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.",Yes
27640,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.",No
27641,That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.,No
27642,And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.,No
27643,Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.,No
27644,"We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.",Yes
27645,And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.,Yes
27646,We then started to build up Afghan forces.,No
27647,"And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.",Yes
27648,"Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.",No
27649,"We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.",No
27650,But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.,No
27651,"And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.",No
27652,"You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.",No
27653,"When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.",No
27654,And what we've said is let's change those certifications.,No
27655,The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.,Yes
27656,"And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population.",Yes
27657,It was higher when I came into office.,Yes
27658,So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.,No
27665,"No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.",Yes
27666,It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.,Yes
27667,"You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.",No
27668,Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.,No
27669,"This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.",Yes
27670,This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.,No
27671,"Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.",No
27672,But we have some work to do.,No
27673,And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.,Yes
27674,We -- we had to go into Pakistan.,No
27675,We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.,No
27676,That was the right thing to do.,No
27677,"And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.",No
27678,But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.,No
27679,And it's important for them.,No
27680,It's important for the nuclear weapons.,No
27681,It's important for the success of Afghanistan.,No
27682,"Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.",No
27684,And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.,No
27685,But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.,No
27686,"But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.",No
27689,"And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.",No
27690,"But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.",No
27691,We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.,Yes
27692,We haven't done that yet.,No
27693,"We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.",No
27694,You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?,No
27696,Is the Middle East in tumult?,No
27698,"Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?",No
27700,Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?,No
27701,"No, they haven't had talks in two years.",No
27702,"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.",No
27703,"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.",No
27704,"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.",Yes
27705,"And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.",Yes
27706,"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.",No
27707,And we have stood on the side of democracy.,No
27708,"One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.",Yes
27709,In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.,Yes
27710,In Libya we stood on the side of the people.,No
27711,"And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.",No
27712,But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.,No
27713,And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.,No
27714,But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.,No
27715,"The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.",Yes
27716,And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.,Yes
27721,"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.",No
27723,"But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.",No
27724,So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.,No
27725,I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.,Yes
27726,And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.,No
27727,That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.,Yes
27728,"And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.",No
27729,"In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.",Yes
27730,We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.,Yes
27731,And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.,Yes
27732,I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.,No
27733,"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.",No
27734,They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.,No
27735,"Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.",No
27736,"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.",Yes
27737,"And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.",No
27740,"Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.",No
27741,It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.,Yes
27742,"Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.",No
27744,"China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.",No
27746,They don't want to see protectionism.,No
27747,"They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.",Yes
27748,So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.,No
27749,And so we can be a partner with China.,No
27750,"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.",No
27751,"We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.",No
27752,"Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?",No
27753,How strong are we going to be?,No
27754,How strong is our economy?,No
27755,"They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.",Yes
27756,They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.,No
27758,The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.,Yes
27759,"It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.",Yes
27760,"It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.",Yes
27761,"They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?",No
27762,"And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.",No
27763,We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.,No
27764,"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.",Yes
27765,It holds down the prices of their goods.,Yes
27766,It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.,No
27768,They're making some progress; they need to make more.,No
27769,"That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.",No
27770,"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.",Yes
27771,They have to understand we want to trade with them.,No
27772,We want a world that's stable.,No
27773,"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.",No
27777,"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.",No
27778,So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.,No
27779,"And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.",Yes
27782,"We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.",Yes
27783,And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.,No
27784,"We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.",No
27786,But this can't keep on going.,No
27787,"You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.",No
27788,"I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.",No
27789,And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.,No
27790,"They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.",Yes
27792,I want a great relationship with China.,No
27793,"China can be our partner, but -- but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.",No
27794,"Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.",Yes
27795,"And, you know, that's -- you're right.",No
27796,I mean that's how our free market works.,No
27797,But I've made a different bet on American workers.,No
27798,"If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.",No
27799,If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.,No
27800,"Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.",Yes
27801,"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.",Yes
27802,"Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.",Yes
27803,We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.,No
27804,"And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.",No
27805,"And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there.",No
27806,"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.",No
27807,And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.,Yes
27808,That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.,Yes
27809,That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.,No
27810,"I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for -- for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.",No
27811,But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.,Yes
27812,Nothing could be further from the truth.,No
27813,I'm a son of Detroit.,No
27817,And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.,No
27818,My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.,No
27819,It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.,No
27821,I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.,No
27822,"And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.",Yes
27825,"Governor Romney, that's not what you said...",Yes
27827,"Governor Romney, you did not...",No
27830,You did not say that you would provide government help.,Yes
27831,"I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.",Yes
27832,Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.,No
27833,"And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not.",No
27838,That's the height of silliness...,No
27840,Let -- let -- let's...,No
27842,I have never said I would liquidate...,No
27846,...I would liquidate the industry.,No
27848,"Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget.",No
27850,...and -- and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.,No
27851,"We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.",No
27852,"We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.",No
27853,"This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.",No
27855,"This is a company, this isn't basic research.",No
27856,I -- I want to invest in research.,No
27858,Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.,No
27863,That's the wrong way to go.,No
27865,The fact of the matter is...,No
27868,So I want to make sure that we make -- we make America more competitive.,No
27870,"And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.",No
27871,But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.,No
27872,In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...,No
27874,...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...,No
27876,I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy.,No
27884,...you've had the floor for a while.,No
27887,"The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.",No
27888,"Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.",No
27889,"You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.",Yes
27890,You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.,No
27892,They would have gone through a...,No
27896,...they would have gone through a...,No
27900,"No, I am not wrong.",No
27903,"People can look it up, you're right.",No
27904,People will look it up.,No
27906,"But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.",No
27907,"Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.",No
27908,That will not help us compete with China.,No
27909,"Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice.",No
27910,That will not help us compete with China.,Yes
27911,"Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.",Yes
27912,Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.,Yes
27913,"Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.",No
27914,"And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.",Yes
27915,What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.,No
27916,That's why we have to move forward and not go back.,No
27917,"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.",No
27918,"The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term.",Yes
27919,Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.,Yes
27920,When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.,Yes
27921,"Today, 47 million people on food stamps.",Yes
27922,"When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.",Yes
27924,You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.,Yes
27925,We're 9 million jobs short of that.,Yes
27926,I've met some of those people.,No
27927,"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.",No
27928,"I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.",Yes
27929,I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.,No
27930,"It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard.",No
27931,"And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.",No
27932,And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.,No
27933,"Look, I love to -- I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that.",No
27934,"By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools.",No
27935,Let the states and localities do that.,No
27937,The federal government didn't hire our teachers.,Yes
27940,But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.,No
27947,"Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.",No
27948,"You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.",No
27949,And now you've got a choice.,No
27950,"Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.",Yes
27951,"And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.",No
27952,And I've got a different vision for America.,No
27953,I want to build on our strengths.,No
27954,"And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.",Yes
27955,I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.,No
27956,And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.,Yes
27957,I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.,No
27959,"As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.",No
27960,"but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.",No
27962,I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.,No
27966,"Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.",No
27968,I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.,No
27969,I want to see peace.,No
27970,I want to see growing peace in this country.,No
27972,We have an opportunity to have real leadership.,No
27973,America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.,No
27974,I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.,No
27975,And there are two very different paths the country can take.,No
27976,"One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece.",Yes
27977,I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.,No
27978,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.,Yes
27979,I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.,No
27980,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.,Yes
27981,I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.,No
27982,The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.,Yes
27983,I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.,No
27984,"I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.",No
27985,"America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.",No
27987,I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.,No
27988,We've got to do that in Washington.,No
27990,"I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.",No
27991,This nation is the hope of the earth.,No
27992,We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.,No
27993,They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.,No
27994,"Now, it's our turn to take that torch.",No
27995,I'm convinced we'll do it.,No
27997,I'd like to be that leader with your support.,No
27999,"I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.",No
28000,I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.,No
28031,I'm glad you clarified that.,No
28036,"Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.",No
28037,"I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.",No
28038,"Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.",No
28039,And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.,No
28040,He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.,No
28041,This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.,Yes
28042,One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.,Yes
28043,"And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured.",No
28044,"Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.",No
28045,"Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.",Yes
28047,I support a strong national patient's bill of rights.,Yes
28048,"It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.",Yes
28050,"I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.",No
28052,"Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.",No
28053,I do support a national patient's bill of rights.,No
28054,"As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.",Yes
28055,"It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.",No
28056,"You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.",No
28057,We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.,Yes
28058,"It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.",No
28059,"It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.",No
28060,"The HMO, the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice.",Yes
28061,"And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.",Yes
28062,But we did something else that was interesting.,No
28063,We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage.,Yes
28064,Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first.,No
28065,"It says if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body.",Yes
28066,"If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules.",No
28067,"However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.",No
28068,"It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.",No
28069,"You know, I support a national patient's bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered.",No
28070,I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.,No
28073,"Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this.",No
28079,I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.,No
28080,It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress.,Yes
28081,"The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.",Yes
28082,"They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.",Yes
28083,It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.,Yes
28085,"And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.",No
28088,"Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.",No
28089,That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.,No
28090,That's what the question in this campaign is about.,No
28091,"It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?",No
28092,And I believe I can.,No
28093,What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?,No
28099,I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patient's bill of rights.,No
28100,"It's kind of Washington, D.C. focus.",No
28101,"Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.",No
28102,"If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.",No
28103,People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court.,No
28104,That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.,Yes
28108,"Well, that's a great question.",No
28109,"I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare.",Yes
28110,"And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there's no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors.",No
28111,"So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.",No
28112,"The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.",No
28113,It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.,No
28114,"So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.",No
28115,"In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.",No
28116,That's part of an overall overhaul.,No
28118,And I'm against price controls.,Yes
28119,I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.,No
28120,Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.,Yes
28121,One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.,No
28122,And so I'm against price controls.,No
28123,"Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.",No
28124,"Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States.",Yes
28126,But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.,No
28128,"All right, here we go again.",No
28129,"Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.",Yes
28130,"If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you.",No
28131,And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.,No
28132,"Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.",Yes
28133,They do some great things.,No
28134,They discover great new cures and that's great.,No
28135,We want them to continue that.,No
28136,But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion.,Yes
28137,You see all these ads?,No
28138,Than they are on research and development.,No
28139,And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.,Yes
28140,I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.,No
28141,"Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.",No
28142,The governor talked about Medicare.,No
28144,"You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.",No
28145,The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.,No
28146,You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.,Yes
28147,"If you're poor, they pay all of it.",Yes
28148,"If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket.",Yes
28149,And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.,No
28150,"And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.",No
28159,"I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all.",No
28160,"We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.",Yes
28161,That adds up to 44 million people.,Yes
28162,That is a national outrage.,No
28163,"We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient's bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that's been left out.",No
28164,We have got to deal with long-term care.,No
28165,"Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.",No
28166,I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.,No
28167,And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate.,No
28168,I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans.,No
28169,"I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.",No
28170,"I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don't like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now.",No
28171,"Now, we have a big difference on this.",No
28172,And you need to know the record here.,No
28173,"Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.",Yes
28174,"Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this.",Yes
28179,I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.,No
28180,I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.,No
28181,I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.,No
28182,They tried to have a national health care plan.,Yes
28184,"I trust people, I don't trust the federal government.",No
28185,It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.,No
28186,I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.,No
28187,"There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is.",No
28188,And we have uninsured people in my state.,No
28189,"Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state.",No
28190,We share a common border with another nation.,No
28191,But we're providing health care for our people.,No
28192,"One thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.",No
28193,"The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America.",No
28194,There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.,No
28195,We need a program for the uninsured.,No
28196,"They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.",No
28197,The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.,Yes
28198,"We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that don't have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance.",Yes
28199,"We need to have -- allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care.",No
28200,So health care needs to be affordable and available.,No
28201,We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.,No
28202,"In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.",No
28203,"The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate.",No
28204,Get a variety of choices to make in their lives.,No

28221,"I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.",No
28222,"I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.",No
28223,I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.,No
28224,"But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.",No
28225,That's why I'm so strong for accountability.,No
28226,"I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.",No
28227,We do so in my state of Texas.,No
28228,One of the good things we've gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.,No
28229,You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.,No
28230,I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.,No
28231,"That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.",Yes
28233,I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.,No
28234,"I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.",No
28235,"Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.",No
28236,We can't continue to shuffle children through school.,No
28237,And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.,No
28240,We have huge difference between us on this question.,No
28241,I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.,No
28242,"I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.",No
28243,"Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.",No
28244,Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.,No
28245,"It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.",Yes
28246,"It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.",No
28247,"We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills.",No

28250,"Now, I said there was a contrast.",No
28251,"Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.",Yes
28252,"And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.",Yes
28253,I think that's a mistake.,No
28254,I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.,No
28255,"I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.",No
28258,"I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.",No
28260,"First of all, vouchers are up to states.",No
28262,I strongly believe in local control of schools.,No
28263,I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.,No
28264,I believe in local control of schools.,No
28265,But here's what I said.,No
28266,"I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.",Yes
28268,We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.,No
28269,And if we find success we'll praise it.,No
28270,"But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.",No
28271,"And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.",Yes
28272,"You see, there has to be a consequence.",No
28273,"We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.",No
28276,"Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.",Yes
28277,"Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.",Yes
28278,"Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.",Yes
28279,"Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.",No
28280,"It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.",Yes
28282,"If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.",No
28283,But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.,No
28284,"We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.",No
28291,What grade do you teach?,No
28294,I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.,No
28295,"Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.",No
28296,"It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.",Yes
28298,And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.,Yes
28299,We've got to do something about this.,No
28300,And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.,No
28301,They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.,Yes
28302,"Look, we're in an information age.",No
28303,Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.,No
28304,"And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.",No
28305,"My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.",Yes
28306,"Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.",No
28307,My plan requires testing of all students.,No
28308,It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.,No
28309,"It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.",No
28310,"We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.",No
28312,"When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.",Yes
28313,And there's just not going to be enough money.,No
28314,"I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.",No
28315,That's what governors ought to do.,No
28316,They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.,No
28317,The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.,Yes
28318,"They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.",Yes
28319,"I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.",No
28320,What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.,No
28321,One size does not fit all.,No
28322,I worry about federalizing education if I were you.,No
28323,"I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.",No
28324,We need to have accountability.,No
28325,"The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.",Yes
28326,We need to demand on results.,No
28327,I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.,No
28328,"I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.",No
28329,Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.,No
28330,You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.,Yes
28331,So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.,No
28332,"So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.",No
28333,There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.,No
28334,"The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.",Yes
28335,94% comes from the local level.,Yes
28339,I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.,No
28340,"Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.",Yes
28341,Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.,No
28342,I'm not just saying this.,No
28344,"I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.",Yes
28345,"And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.",No
28346,"One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?",Yes
28347,We get nothing for it.,No
28348,We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.,No
28350,That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.,Yes
28351,"Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.",Yes
28354,(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.,No
28355,It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.,Yes
28358,"That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.",Yes
28362,He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.,Yes
28363,This is a big spender.,No
28364,"And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.",No
28365,We just have a different philosophy.,No
28366,Let me talk about tax relief.,No
28367,"If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.",No
28368,The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.,Yes
28370,"I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.",No
28371,"And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.",No
28372,But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.,Yes
28373,And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.,Yes
28374,"If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.",Yes
28375,What I've done is set priorities and funded them.,No
28377,And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.,No
28378,It's a difference of opinion.,No
28379,He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.,No
28380,I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.,No
28381,It's just the right position to take.,No
28382,Can we take the time --,No
28387,"If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.",No
28388,People who pay taxes will get tax relief.,Yes
28392,"Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.",Yes
28396,Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.,No
28397,"If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.",Yes
28398,So I want to do something about that.,No
28401,"Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.",No
28403,And I want to come back to something I said before.,No
28404,"If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.",No
28405,"If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man.",No
28407,"Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.",No
28408,"I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.",No
28411,I'm not going to ask them.,No
28412,"But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.",Yes
28413,Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.,No
28416,50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.,Yes
28418,"You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.",No
28419,"And secondly, we've had enough fighting.",No
28421,You talk about eight years?,No
28422,"In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights.",No
28423,It's time to get something done.,No
28424,"Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.",No
28426,Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.,Yes
28427,"It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not you're using facts that aren't right.",Yes
28428,And that fact is just not right.,Yes
28439,I've got a strategy for the Middle East.,No
28440,"And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.",No
28441,Our nation needs to be credible and strong.,No
28442,"When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody has got to believe it.",No
28443,Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.,No
28444,We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.,No
28445,I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.,No
28446,We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.,No
28447,It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.,No
28448,"We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.",No
28449,You can't worry about polls or focus groups.,No
28450,You've got to have a clear vision.,No
28451,That's what a leader does.,No
28452,A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.,No
28453,Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.,No
28454,Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.,No
28456,"The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don't know because inspectors aren't in.",Yes
28457,"So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.",No
28459,"I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.",No
28460,Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.,No
28461,We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.,No
28462,Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.,Yes
28463,I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.,No
28464,"Now, what can I bring to that challenge?",No
28465,"When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War.",No
28466,"When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.",No
28467,"I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.",No
28468,"I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.",No
28469,"In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.",Yes
28470,"Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.",No
28471,I've worked on that long and hard.,No
28472,"When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.",No
28473,"And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.",No
28474,"In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.",Yes
28475,And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.,No
28476,Can I say just one other thing here?,No
28482,"I think he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right, go ahead.",No
28487,"Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.",No
28488,"Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.",No
28489,And our team of -- our country's team over there did a great job.,No
28491,The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.,No
28492,And that means keeping our military strong.,No
28493,"Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.",No
28494,"And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.",Yes
28495,I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.,No
28496,The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology.,Yes
28497,"I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.",No
28498,"You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.",Yes
28500,"The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced.",Yes
28501,I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.,No
28502,And I'm happy to tell you that we have.,No
28503,"Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose.",No
28504,The governor proposes $45 billion.,Yes
28505,I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.,No
28507,"If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.",No
28508,I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.,No
28510,"It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.",No
28511,The mission must be clear.,No
28512,Soldiers must understand why we're going.,No
28513,The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.,No
28514,And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.,No
28515,I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world.,No
28516,"See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy.",No
28517,"Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.",No
28518,And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,No
28519,"There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often.",Yes
28520,The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.,No
28521,"I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.",No
28522,"But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.",Yes
28523,"We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.",No
28524,"This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.",No
28525,Spending money is one thing.,No
28526,But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.,No
28527,"First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.",No
28534,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.",No
28537,I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.,No
28538,"But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.",No
28543,"Well, I don't think I ran the ad.",No
28544,I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad.,No
28546,I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.,No
28547,"Here is what I believe, sir.",No
28548,I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families.,No
28549,I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.,No
28550,"That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows, I'm for trigger locks, I think that makes sense.",No
28551,"Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe.",Yes
28552,I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.,No
28553,But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.,No
28554,"If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence.",No
28555,"If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.",No
28556,"Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help.",No
28557,"There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.",Yes
28558,To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.,No
28559,"And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.",No
28560,I'm a pretty independent thinker.,No
28561,The one thing I'm for is a safe society.,No
28562,And I'm for enforcing laws on the books.,No
28563,And that's what is going to happen should I earn your confidence.,No
28565,"Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.",No
28566,"But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.",Yes
28567,Let me tell you my position.,No
28568,I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people.,No
28569,"But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety.",Yes
28570,"None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.",No
28571,They're aimed at the real problem.,No
28572,"Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.",No
28573,"Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.",No
28574,"But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago.",No
28575,Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government.,No
28577,And let me tell you what the record shows.,No
28578,For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government.,Yes
28579,"And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.",No
28580,"The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people.",Yes
28581,And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.,Yes
28582,"During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size.",Yes
28583,"Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.",Yes
28584,"Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.",No
28592,We've got a bumper crop this year.,No
28593,But that's the good news.,No
28594,You know what the bad news is that follows on that.,No
28596,"In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.",No
28597,I want to change many of its provisions.,No
28599,Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.,Yes
28600,"And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.",No
28601,I want to change those provisions.,No
28602,I want to restore a meaningful safety net.,No
28603,"And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.",No
28604,"And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.",No
28605,"And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.",No
28606,I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.,No
28607,"And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.",No
28608,"Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.",No
28609,I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.,No
28610,"So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.",No
28612,I would like our farmers feeding the world.,No
28613,"We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.",No
28614,We need to open up markets.,No
28615,"Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.",Yes
28616,I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.,No
28617,WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the best and the most efficient farmers.,No
28618,I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.,No
28619,We shouldn't be using food.,No
28621,It's not the right thing to do.,No
28623,We need more work on value-added processing.,No
28624,"You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.",No
28626,I'm for research and development.,No
28627,Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.,No
28628,"I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax.",No
28629,One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.,Yes
28630,This is a bad tax.,No
28631,The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.,No
28632,It's a tax that taxes people twice.,Yes
28633,It penalizes the family farmer.,Yes
28634,"So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.",No
28635,I'm from a big farm state.,No
28636,We're the second biggest state -- farming state in the country.,No
28637,And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.,No
28638,"The Vice President is right, by the way.",No
28639,Every day is earth day if you own the land.,No
28640,I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.,No
28646,I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.,No
28647,"And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.",Yes
28648,"And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced.",Yes
28649,So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.,Yes
28650,"The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.",No
28651,"And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.",No
28656,Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets.,No
28657,It's either unfair for some or unfair for all.,No
28658,"Again, this is just a difference of opinion.",No
28659,"If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.",No
28660,I don't think that's the role of the president.,No
28661,"I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.",No
28662,"Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.",No
28663,It is -- I'm not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.,Yes
28665,I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.,No
28667,"It's an issue of principle, not politics.",No
28683,"Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.",No
28684,Government ought to stand on the side of parents.,No
28685,"Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.",No
28686,You bet there's things that government can do.,No
28687,We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour.,No
28688,We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.,No
28689,"There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.",No
28690,I think we ought to have character education in our schools.,No
28691,"I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.",No
28692,"Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.",No
28694,I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.,No
28695,That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.,No
28696,"Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free.",No
28697,And so I don't support censorship.,No
28698,But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.,No
28699,I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.,No
28700,"I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.",No
28701,"I'll remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.",No
28702,I was on my peroration.,No
28705,I care a lot about this.,No
28706,"It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.",No
28707,Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.,No
28708,Tipper and I have four children.,No
28709,"And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.",No
28711,"She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.",No
28712,And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.,No
28713,And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.,No
28714,I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.,Yes
28715,And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.,No
28716,"You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.",No
28717,"But if you can check up on them, that's real power.",No
28718,"And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.",Yes
28720,Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.,Yes
28721,"And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.",No
28722,"I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.",No
28723,"Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.",No
28729,Right next to the last.,No
28734,We've got to change it.,No
28735,"I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.",No
28736,And I want to tell you what I tell them.,No
28737,"Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed.",No
28738,But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.,No
28740,"Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.",No
28741,And that is the current campaign financing system.,No
28742,And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.,No
28744,"I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.",No
28746,I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.,No
28747,"Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.",No
28748,Let me tell you why.,No
28749,"Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made.",Yes
28750,"The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.",Yes
28752,The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.,Yes
28753,"They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.",No
28754,We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.,No
28755,And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be.,No
28758,Tell you what I hear.,No
28759,"A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they don't want any part of politics.",No
28760,They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.,No
28761,"There's a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?",No
28762,"And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense.",No
28763,"Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike.",No
28764,We better get it right now.,No
28765,Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.,No
28766,I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.,No
28767,I think it's the tone.,No
28768,I think it's the attitude.,No
28769,I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.,No
28770,"Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.",No
28771,"One, could our family endure all this business.",No
28772,And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.,No
28773,"The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for your vote.",No
28774,That's what happened in Texas.,No
28776,There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.,No
28778,"He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas.",No
28780,I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.,No
28781,What I cared about is could we work together.,No
28782,"That's what Washington, D.C. needs.",No
28783,"And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.",No
28784,That's the best way to get people back in the system.,No
28791,"I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.",No
28792,I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.,No
28793,"But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.",No
28794,"I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy.",No
28797,Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.,No
28799,It's not the way America is all about.,No
28800,But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.,No
28801,"For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.",Yes
28802,"And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.",Yes
28803,It was a smart thing to do.,No
28804,"What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.",No
28805,I think the contracting business in government can help.,No
28806,"Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example.",No
28807,"The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.",No
28808,"I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.",No
28809,"So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.",No
28810,I'll have an administration that will make you proud.,No
28813,I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.,No
28814,"I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together.",No
28816,"Well, you establish respect for differences.",No
28818,"It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.",No
28819,"Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.",No
28820,I don't know what affirmative access means.,No
28821,I do know what affirmative action means.,No
28822,"I know the governor is against it, and I know that I'm for it.",No
28823,I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death.,Yes
28824,"I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.",Yes
28825,I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.,No
28826,I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity.,No
28827,"And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.",No
28828,Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.,No
28829,"And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.",Yes
28830,And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.,No
28831,"Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws.",No
28833,"This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.",No
28835,"I'm against quotas, they're illegal.",No
28836,They're against the American way.,No
28837,"Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.",No
28839,"If affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it.",No
28840,"If affirmative action means what I just described what I'm for, then I'm for it.",No
28841,You heard what I was for.,No
28842,The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.,No
28843,"You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.",No
28845,"He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.",Yes
28846,Affirmative action doesn't mean quotas.,No
28847,Are you for it without quotas?,No
28848,"I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.",No
28849,Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?,No
28852,"No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.",No
28857,"If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000.",Yes
28858,"If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500.",Yes

28863,"If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit.",Yes
28864,"Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families.",Yes
28865,"And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.",No
28866,"$3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.",No
28868,"Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded it's gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have.",No
28869,You're going to get a tax relief in my plan.,No
28870,You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.,No
28871,Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief.,No
28872,"If you take care of an elderly in your home, you're going to get the personal exemption increased.",Yes
28873,"I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare?",No
28874,"You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.",No
28875,"Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.",No
28876,"If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.",Yes
28877,You're stuck in a time warp in many ways.,No
28878,So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.,No
28879,You're going to live in a peaceful world.,No
28880,It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.,No
28881,A mission that doesn't try to be all things to all people.,No
28882,A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.,No
28883,"You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.",No
28884,"See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.",No
28885,You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.,No
28886,"The harder you work, the more you can keep.",No
28888,Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.,No
28889,It's what the federal government does to you.,No
28890,"It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.",No
28896,"No, I'm not proud of that.",No
28897,"The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo.",No
28898,It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.,No
28899,I take my job seriously.,No
28901,I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.,No
28902,During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.,No
28903,I said I did if administered fairly and justly.,No
28904,"Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.",No
28905,"If it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.",No
28906,"One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.",No
28907,"You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.",No
28908,"And that's what I did, sir.",No
28909,There have been some tough cases come across my desk.,No
28910,Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.,No
28911,"But my job is to ask two questions, sir.",No
28912,Is the person guilty of the crime?,No
28913,And did the person have full access to the courts of law?,No
28914,"And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.",No
28915,I'm not proud of any record.,No
28916,I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas.,Yes
28917,I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.,No
28920,I support the death penalty.,Yes
28921,"I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.",No
28922,"If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?",No
28923,"If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.",No
28924,"Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.",Yes
28925,And in some cases may be still at large.,No
28926,But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.,No
28930,It's the only reason to be for it.,No
28932,I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.,No
28933,I don't think that's right.,No
28934,I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.,No
28935,I think it is a deterrent.,No
28936,"I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.",No
28943,(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.,No
28944,"And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.",Yes
28945,I think the record shows otherwise.,No
28946,We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.,Yes
28947,"Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.",Yes
28948,"22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.",Yes
28949,"Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.",Yes
28950,Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.,No
28951,I will balance the budget every year.,No
28952,I will pay down the debt every year.,No
28953,"I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.",No
28954,"And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.",No
28955,We both made promises in this campaign.,No
28957,Let me tell you about one of the governor's.,No
28959,"But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.",Yes
28960,So this is a show me state.,No
28961,"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money.""",No
28962,"Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?",No
28964,Thank you for your question.,No
28967,"You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.",Yes
28968,You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.,Yes
28970,There's too much bitterness in Washington.,No
28972,It's time to have a fresh start.,No
28973,One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.,No
28974,"When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.",No
28975,"(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.",Yes
28977,And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.,No
28978,And then I brought folks together to get it done.,No
28979,"And that's what we need, I think, in this election.",No
28980,To me that's what it's all about.,No
28981,"I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.",No
28982,"But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.",No
28983,"One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.",Yes
28984,"Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.",Yes
28985,People are going to get paid.,No
28986,"But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.",No
28987,And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.,Yes
28988,That's one of my promises.,No
28989,But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.,No
28991,There was a chance to get this done.,No
28992,"It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.",Yes
28993,I'm going to bring them together.,No
28997,"Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.",No
28998,Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.,Yes
28999,And you cannot keep both promises.,No
29000,"If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.",Yes
29001,Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.,No
29002,Now that is the difference.,No
29003,"And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.",No
29004,"This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.",No
29005,The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.,Yes
29006,"You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.",No
29007,It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.,Yes
29008,"If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?",No
29009,Now let me come directly to your question.,No
29012,One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.,No
29013,The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.,Yes
29014,There's just a difference of opinion.,No
29015,I want workers to have their own assets.,No
29016,"It's who you trust, government or people.",No
29020,"Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.",No
29021,I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country.,No
29022,"Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.",No
29023,I would like to tell you something about me.,No
29025,I have kept the faith.,No
29026,I've kept the faith with my country.,No
29027,I volunteered for the Army.,No
29029,I kept the faith with my family.,No
29030,Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.,No
29031,We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.,No
29032,I have kept the faith with our country.,No
29033,"Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath.",Yes
29034,I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.,No
29035,I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.,No
29036,I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.,No
29037,"If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.",No
29038,We've made some progress during the last eight years.,No
29039,We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.,Yes
29040,Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.,Yes
29041,"Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.",Yes
29042,You ain't seen nothing yet.,No
29043,And I will keep that promise.,No
29045,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president.",No
29046,"Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion.",No
29047,I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion.,No
29048,There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.,No
29049,I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.,No
29050,It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.,Yes
29051,"It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.",No
29052,A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.,No
29053,I want to have the military keeping the peace.,No
29054,I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.,No
29055,"After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.",No
29056,I don't think the surplus is the government's money.,No
29057,I think it's the people's money.,No
29058,"I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.",No
29059,And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.,No
29061,I'm asking for your vote.,No
29063,"For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once.",No
29064,"(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise.",No
29065,"Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.",No
29101,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.",No
29102,The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,No
29103,"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.",No
29104,"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",No
29105,"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",No
29106,I want us to invest in you.,No
29107,I want us to invest in your future.,No
29108,"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",No
29109,We also have to make the economy fairer.,No
29110,"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",No
29111,I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,No
29112,"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",No
29113,And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,No
29114,I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,No
29115,"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",No
29116,Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,No
29117,How are we going to do it?,No
29118,We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,No
29119,"Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.",No
29120,We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,No
29121,"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",No
29122,I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,No
29128,Our jobs are fleeing the country.,Yes
29130,They're going to many other countries.,Yes
29131,You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,No
29132,"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.",Yes
29133,And we have a very good fight.,No
29134,And we have a winning fight.,No
29135,"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.",Yes
29136,"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",No
29137,"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",No
29138,"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.",No
29139,"With the United States, as he said, not so much.",No
29141,"You see that, their small car division leaving.",Yes
29142,"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.",Yes
29144,And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,No
29145,"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.",No
29146,"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",No
29147,But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,No
29148,"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",No
29149,All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,No
29150,"They left -- fired 1,400 people.",Yes
29152,So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,Yes
29153,We cannot let it happen.,No
29154,"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",No
29155,That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,No
29156,It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,No
29161,"And I look very, very much forward to doing it.",No
29162,"We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",No
29164,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue.",No
29165,"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",No
29166,"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",No
29167,"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",No
29168,And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,Yes
29169,"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",Yes
29170,"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.",No
29171,That is not how we grow the economy.,No
29172,"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",No
29173,I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,No
29175,"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",No
29176,"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.",Yes
29178,I have a different experience.,No
29179,My father was a small-businessman.,No
29181,"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",No
29182,"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.",No
29183,That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,No
29188,"Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.",Yes
29189,Our country's in deep trouble.,No
29190,"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.",No
29191,"They're the best, the best ever at it.",No
29192,"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.",No
29193,So we have to do that.,No
29194,We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,No
29195,"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.",Yes
29196,Let me give you the example of Mexico.,No
29197,They have a VAT tax.,Yes
29198,We're on a different system.,No
29199,"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.",Yes
29200,"When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.",Yes
29201,"When they sell into us, there's no tax.",Yes
29203,"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.",Yes
29204,"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?",No
29206,I want you to be very happy.,No
29207,It's very important to me.,No
29208,"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.",No
29209,She's been doing this for 30 years.,No
29210,And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,No
29211,The NAFTA agreement is defective.,No
29212,"Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...",No
29214,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.",No
29215,They should have been doing this for years.,No
29216,"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.",Yes
29217,"We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",No
29219,"How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?",No
29220,How do you make them bring the jobs back?,No
29221,"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.",No
29223,"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.",Yes
29224,"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.",Yes
29225,"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",No
29226,We wish you a lot of luck.,No
29227,"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.",No
29228,"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.",No
29229,"So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.",No
29230,We have to stop them from leaving.,No
29231,"And that's a big, big factor.",No
29233,"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.",No
29234,"We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.",Yes
29235,"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.",Yes
29236,"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.",Yes
29237,"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.""",Yes
29239,"That's called business, by the way.",No
29240,Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.,Yes
29241,Five million people lost their homes.,Yes
29242,And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,Yes
29243,"Now, we have come back from that abyss.",Yes
29244,And it has not been easy.,No
29245,"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.",No
29246,"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.",Yes
29247,"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.",Yes
29249,Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,No
29250,Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,Yes
29254,I do not say that.,Yes
29255,I think science is real.,No
29256,I do not say that.,No
29257,"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.",No
29258,And here's what we can do.,No
29259,We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,No
29260,We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,Yes
29261,We can build a new modern electric grid.,No
29262,That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,No
29263,"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",No
29265,She talks about solar panels.,No
29266,"We invested in a solar company, our country.",Yes
29268,They lost plenty of money on that one.,Yes
29269,"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.",Yes
29270,Our energy policies are a disaster.,No
29271,"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.",Yes
29272,You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,Yes
29273,"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",Yes
29274,"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.",Yes
29275,So I will tell you this.,No
29276,We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,No
29277,"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.",No
29278,"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.",Yes
29279,"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.",No
29280,You've been doing this for 30 years.,No
29281,Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?,No
29282,"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",Yes
29284,I will bring -- excuse me.,No
29285,I will bring back jobs.,No
29286,You can't bring back jobs.,No
29287,"Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.",No
29289,"And I have -- well, not quite that long.",No
29290,I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.,No
29291,I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...,No
29294,"... million new jobs, a balanced budget...",No
29295,"He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.",Yes
29296,Incomes went up for everybody.,Yes
29297,"Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.",Yes
29298,"When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.",No
29299,Will they create jobs in America?,No
29300,Will they raise incomes in America?,No
29301,And are they good for our national security?,No
29302,Some of them I voted for.,No
29303,"The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.",Yes
29304,And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.,No
29305,But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,No
29306,"I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.",No
29307,I'm going to have a special prosecutor.,No
29308,"We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.",No
29309,"When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.",Yes
29310,We increased them to China 50 percent.,Yes
29311,So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,No
29313,But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,Yes
29314,"Well, I've been a senator, Donald...",No
29317,And I have been a secretary of state...,No
29319,And I have done a lot...,No
29320,"Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.",Yes
29323,"You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.",Yes
29324,"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.",No
29325,And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.,Yes
29326,You were totally in favor of it.,Yes
29327,"Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.",No
29328,"But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.",No
29329,Nothing will ever top NAFTA.,No
29330,"Well, that is just not accurate.",No
29331,I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.,Yes
29332,I wrote about that in...,No
29333,You called it the gold standard.,No
29335,You called it the gold standard of trade deals.,Yes
29336,You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,No
29338,"And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.",Yes
29339,"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.",No
29340,"The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...",Yes
29342,"... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.",No
29343,I wrote about that in my book...,No
29344,So is it President Obama's fault?,No
29346,Is it President Obama's fault?,No
29348,"Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?",No
29351,"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.",No
29352,And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,No
29353,"That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.",Yes
29354,But you have no plan.,No
29355,"But in -- oh, but I do.",No
29356,"Secretary, you have no plan.",No
29357,"In fact, I have written a book about it.",No
29359,You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...,No
29363,... or at an airport near you.,No
29365,"But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.",No
29366,We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,No
29367,So we have a very robust set of plans.,No
29368,"And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.",Yes
29369,You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.,Yes
29370,You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.,Yes
29371,You are going to drive business out.,No
29372,"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.",No
29373,"And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.",Yes
29374,I'm very proud of it.,No
29375,It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,No
29376,"But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.",No
29377,"When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.",No
29378,"And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.",No
29379,"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.",Yes
29380,And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.,No
29381,I'm going to cut regulations.,No
29382,"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.",No
29385,That can't -- that can't be left to stand.,No
29387,"I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...",No
29389,"So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.",No
29390,"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.",No
29391,Because what I have proposed...,No
29392,"And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.",No
29393,"... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.",Yes
29394,What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.,Yes
29395,"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.",No
29396,And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,No
29398,"Well, could I just finish -- I think I...",No
29401,"I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.",No
29403,She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.,Yes
29405,And look at her website.,No
29407,It's no difference than this.,No
29408,She's telling us how to fight ISIS.,No
29409,Just go to her website.,No
29410,She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.,No
29411,I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.,No
29413,"Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.",No
29415,"No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.",No
29418,"See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.",No
29419,No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.,Yes
29420,"That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.",No
29430,"Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.",No
29431,They're going to expand their companies.,No
29432,They're going to do a tremendous job.,No
29433,I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.,No
29434,"And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.",No
29435,It's a great thing for the middle class.,No
29436,It's a great thing for companies to expand.,No
29437,"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.",Yes
29438,"So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.",Yes
29439,"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.",No
29440,"Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.",Yes
29441,Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,No
29443,"Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.",Yes
29444,I happen to think it's double that.,No
29445,"It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.",Yes
29446,"And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.",No
29447,But we have no leadership.,No
29448,"And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.",No
29451,"I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.",No
29456,"You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.",No
29457,"Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...",No
29458,There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.,No
29461,"Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.",No
29462,We've looked at your tax proposals.,No
29463,"I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.",No
29464,I happen to support that.,No
29465,Then you didn't read it.,No
29466,I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,No
29467,"But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.",Yes
29468,You've proposed an approach that has a...,No
29469,Who gave it that name?,No
29470,The first I've -- who gave it that name?,No
29473,... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.,Yes
29474,And when you look at what you are proposing...,No
29476,How much for my family?,No
29479,"... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.",No
29481,"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.",Yes
29482,Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,Yes
29483,"And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.",No
29484,"And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.",No
29485,I don't think top-down works in America.,No
29486,"I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.",No
29487,Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.,No
29488,"Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.",No
29494,Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,No
29495,"Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.",Yes
29496,And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.,No
29497,"And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.",Yes
29498,"We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.",No
29499,And we better be awfully careful.,No
29500,And we have a Fed that's doing political things.,No
29501,This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,No
29502,The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.,Yes
29503,"And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.",No
29504,The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,No
29508,I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.,No
29510,"And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.",No
29511,"But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.",Yes
29512,"It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.",Yes
29513,"If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.",No
29514,But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,No
29515,"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.",Yes
29516,You know what that is?,No
29517,"That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?",No
29518,We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.,No
29523,"Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.",No
29524,"Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.",Yes
29525,I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.,No
29526,"I said, do you get audited?",No
29527,I get audited almost every year.,Yes
29528,"And in a way, I should be complaining.",No
29531,It's almost become a way of life.,No
29532,I get audited by the IRS.,Yes
29535,We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,No
29536,"I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.",Yes
29537,"As soon as she releases them, I will release.",No
29539,I will release my tax returns.,No
29540,"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it.""",No
29541,I will tell you this.,No
29542,"No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.",No
29543,"Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.",Yes
29544,"When the audit's complete, I'll do it.",No
29545,But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.,No
29548,Let her release the e-mails.,No
29549,"Why did she delete 33,000...",No
29555,"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.",No
29556,"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",Yes
29557,"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",Yes
29558,We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,Yes
29559,"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",No
29560,And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,No
29561,"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.",No
29562,"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",No
29563,"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.",Yes
29564,"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.",Yes
29566,"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",No
29567,"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",No
29568,"And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.",No
29569,They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,Yes
29570,And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,No
29571,"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.",No
29573,We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,No
29574,"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",No
29575,Who does he owe money to?,No
29576,"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",No
29580,"You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.",No
29582,"And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.",No
29583,But I'm not going to make any excuses.,No
29584,"It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.",No
29586,That was more than a mistake.,No
29589,That was not a mistake.,No
29591,"When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.",Yes
29592,"And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.",No
29593,"As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.",No
29594,That I can tell you.,No
29595,You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,No
29596,And you should go down and take a look at that.,No
29597,"The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.",No
29598,"The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.",No
29599,It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,No
29600,"The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.",Yes
29601,And the $650 isn't even on that.,No
29603,It's much less than that.,No
29604,"But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.",No
29605,"These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.",No
29606,I could do that very quickly.,No
29608,I have a great company.,No
29609,I have a tremendous income.,No
29610,And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,No
29611,It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,No
29612,"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",Yes
29613,Our airports are like from a third world country.,No
29614,"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.",No
29615,So the worst of all things has happened.,No
29616,"We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",Yes
29618,"And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.",Yes
29619,"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.",Yes
29620,And it's really a shame.,No
29621,And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,No
29622,Our country has tremendous problems.,No
29624,We're a serious debtor nation.,Yes
29625,"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.",No
29626,"And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.",Yes
29628,And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,Yes
29630,And the other thing I think is important...,No
29631,"It would be squandered, too, believe me.",No
29632,"... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.",No
29633,"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.",No
29634,"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.",No
29635,"I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.",Yes
29636,We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,No
29638,It immediately was put to use.,No
29639,"And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...",No
29640,Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...,No
29642,"Which our country should do, too.",No
29643,"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?",No
29644,I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,No
29645,"He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.",No
29646,"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.",Yes
29647,There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,No
29648,You call yourself the King of Debt.,No
29650,You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,Yes
29653,"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",No
29655,And we need to be very clear about that.,No
29656,"So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.",No
29657,"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.",No
29658,I built an unbelievable company.,No
29659,"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.",No
29661,"But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.",Yes
29662,"And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.",Yes
29663,"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.",No
29664,But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,No
29665,"My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.",No
29666,And that's what I do.,No
29667,But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.,No
29668,I'll give you an example.,No
29669,"We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.",No
29670,But we're opening the Old Post Office.,No
29671,"Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.",Yes
29672,I'm a year ahead of schedule.,Yes
29673,And that's what this country should be doing.,No
29674,We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.,Yes
29675,"We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.",Yes
29676,"When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.",No
29677,The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.,Yes
29678,And we should be able to do that for our country.,No
29687,Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,No
29688,"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.",Yes
29689,We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,No
29690,And we've got to do several things at the same time.,No
29691,We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,No
29692,"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",No
29693,"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",No
29694,"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",No
29695,"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",Yes
29696,I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,No
29697,"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",No
29698,So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,No
29699,And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,No
29700,"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.",Yes
29701,"So we have to do two things, as I said.",No
29702,We have to restore trust.,No
29703,We have to work with the police.,No
29704,We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,No
29705,"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",No
29708,"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",No
29709,And we need law and order.,No
29710,"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",No
29711,"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.",No
29712,"I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.",No
29713,"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.",Yes
29714,"We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.",Yes
29715,"You walk down the street, you get shot.",No
29716,"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.",Yes
29718,"And I'm saying, where is this?",No
29719,Is this a war-torn country?,No
29721,And we have to stop the violence.,No
29722,We have to bring back law and order.,No
29723,"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.",Yes
29724,We have to bring back law and order.,No
29725,"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.",Yes
29726,It brought the crime rate way down.,Yes
29727,But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,No
29728,We have gangs roaming the street.,No
29729,"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",Yes
29732,And we have to be very strong.,No
29733,And we have to be very vigilant.,No
29734,We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,No
29735,"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.",No
29736,"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",Yes
29740,"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.",Yes
29741,It was taken away from her.,Yes
29742,"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",Yes
29743,They would have won an appeal.,No
29744,"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",Yes
29746,"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.",No
29748,"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.",Yes
29750,"You need a better community, you know, relation.",No
29751,You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,No
29754,It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,No
29755,"But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.",No
29757,I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,No
29758,"You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.",No
29759,"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.",No
29760,So there's some bad things going on.,No
29763,"But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.",No
29764,"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",Yes
29765,And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,No
29767,"Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",No
29769,"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",No
29770,There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,No
29771,But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,No
29772,"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",No
29773,"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",Yes
29774,It did not do what it needed to do.,No
29775,"Now, I believe in community policing.",No
29776,"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.",Yes
29777,Property crime is down 40 percent.,Yes
29778,We just don't want to see it creep back up.,No
29779,We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,No
29780,"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",No
29781,Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,Yes
29782,"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",Yes
29783,So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,No
29784,We cannot just say law and order.,No
29785,"We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.",No
29786,We need to have more second chance programs.,No
29787,I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,Yes
29788,You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,No
29789,So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,No
29790,And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,No
29791,"Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.",Yes
29792,"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",Yes
29793,"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",No
29794,And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,No
29795,"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.",No
29796,"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",No
29799,"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.",No
29800,"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",No
29801,"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",No
29802,"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",Yes
29803,"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.",No
29804,They admit it's an issue.,No
29805,They've got a lot of concerns.,No
29806,"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",No
29807,"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.",Yes
29808,And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,No
29810,I'd like to respond to that.,No
29812,"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.",No
29814,"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",No
29815,"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.",No
29816,But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,No
29817,"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",No
29818,But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,No
29819,I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,No
29820,"And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.",No
29821,I think you've apologized for it.,Yes
29822,But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,No
29823,"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.",No
29824,"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",No
29825,"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.",No
29826,"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",Yes
29827,Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,No
29828,"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?",No
29829,"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",Yes
29830,And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,Yes
29831,And it was terminated by current mayor.,Yes
29832,But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,Yes
29834,"So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",No
29835,"It had a very, very big impact.",No
29836,"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.",Yes
29844,New York -- New York has done an excellent job.,No
29845,"And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.",No
29846,"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.",No
29847,"Look, one murder is too many.",No
29848,But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,No
29849,And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,No
29850,Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,No
29851,"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.",No
29852,"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.",No
29855,"I'd like to just respond, if I might.",No
29857,I'd just like to respond.,No
29860,"Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.",No
29861,"They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.",No
29862,"The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.",No
29863,"They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.",No
29864,They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,Yes
29867,"Well, I -- I do think...",No
29868,"And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.",No
29869,"You decided to stay home, and that's OK.",No
29870,"But I will tell you, I've been all over.",No
29871,And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,No
29872,"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",No
29874,I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.,No
29876,And you know what else I prepared for?,No
29877,I prepared to be president.,No
29878,And I think that's a good thing.,No
29884,"I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.",No
29885,Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.,No
29886,"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.",No
29887,"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.",No
29888,"And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.",No
29889,"Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.",Yes
29890,They were pressing it very hard.,Yes
29891,She failed to get the birth certificate.,Yes
29892,"When I got involved, I didn't fail.",Yes
29893,I got him to give the birth certificate.,No
29894,So I'm satisfied with it.,No
29895,And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,No
29898,"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.",No
29907,"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.",No
29908,"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",No
29909,But nobody was caring much about it.,No
29910,But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,Yes
29911,And I think I did a good job.,No
29912,Secretary Clinton also fought it.,Yes
29913,"I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.",No
29915,"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.",No
29917,"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.",No
29923,"Well, it was very -- I say nothing.",No
29924,"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.",No
29925,He should have produced it a long time before.,No
29927,But let me just tell you.,No
29928,"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.",No
29929,I think you can see that.,No
29930,And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,No
29931,"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",No
29933,"Well, just listen to what you heard.",No
29935,"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.",No
29936,But it can't be dismissed that easily.,No
29937,He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,Yes
29938,"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.",Yes
29939,"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",Yes
29940,He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,Yes
29941,So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,Yes
29942,And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,No
29943,"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",No
29944,And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,No
29945,"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.",No
29946,"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.",No
29948,I would love to respond.,No
29949,"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.",No
29950,You treated him with terrible disrespect.,No
29951,And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,No
29952,It doesn't work that way.,No
29953,"You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.",Yes
29954,I don't think you can deny that.,No
29955,"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.",Yes
29956,"So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.",No
29958,"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.",Yes
29959,We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,Yes
29960,It was very easy to do.,No
29961,I notice you bring that up a lot.,No
29962,"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.",No
29963,Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,No
29964,"But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?",No
29965,"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.",Yes
29966,I'll go one step further.,No
29967,"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.",No
29968,"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.",No
29969,And it's a tremendously successful club.,No
29970,And I'm so glad I did it.,No
29971,And I have been given great credit for what I did.,No
29972,"And I'm very, very proud of it.",No
29973,And that's the way I feel.,No
29974,That is the true way I feel.,No
29981,"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",No
29982,There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.,No
29983,"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.",Yes
29984,The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,No
29985,"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.",Yes
29986,"I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...",No
29989,"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.",Yes
29990,"And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.",Yes
29991,"We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.",No
29992,"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.",No
29993,And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.,No
29994,We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,No
29995,But we will defend the citizens of this country.,No
29996,And the Russians need to understand that.,No
29997,"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.",No
29998,And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,Yes
30000,It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...,Yes
30002,... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.,Yes
30003,It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,No
30007,"I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.",Yes
30008,"That just happened, and many more are coming.",Yes
30009,And I'm very proud of it.,No
30010,"In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.",No
30011,They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.,Yes
30012,I was just endorsed by ICE.,No
30013,"I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.",Yes
30014,"So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.",No
30016,Because look at the mess that we're in.,No
30017,Look at the mess that we're in.,No
30018,"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.",No
30019,"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",No
30020,I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.,Yes
30021,"She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.",No
30022,"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.",No
30023,It could also be lots of other people.,No
30024,"It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?",No
30025,You don't know who broke in to DNC.,No
30026,But what did we learn with DNC?,No
30027,"We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.",Yes
30028,Look what happened to her.,No
30029,But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.,No
30031,"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.",No
30032,"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.",No
30034,"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.",No
30035,It is -- it is a huge problem.,No
30039,"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.",No
30040,"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.",No
30041,And maybe it's hardly doable.,No
30042,"But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.",No
30043,But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.,No
30044,"We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",No
30046,"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.",No
30047,I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,No
30048,It does involve going after them online.,No
30049,"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.",No
30050,"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.",No
30052,Our military is assisting in Iraq.,Yes
30053,"And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.",No
30054,"But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.",Yes
30055,And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,No
30056,"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",Yes
30057,"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",No
30058,"Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",No
30062,"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",No
30063,Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,Yes
30064,We will take out ISIS.,No
30065,"Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.",No
30067,So she talks about taking them out.,No
30068,She's been doing it a long time.,No
30069,She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,Yes
30070,"But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.",No
30071,And then you wouldn't have had them.,No
30072,"Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.",Yes
30073,"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",No
30075,"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.",No
30076,Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,Yes
30078,That is absolutely proved over and over again.,No
30081,"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",Yes
30082,"But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.",Yes
30083,"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",No
30084,"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.",No
30085,"The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?",No
30086,That's the most important part of this.,No
30087,How do we prevent attacks?,No
30088,How do we protect our people?,No
30089,"And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.",No
30090,"I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.",No
30091,"You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.",No
30092,And they brought him down.,No
30093,"And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.",No
30094,"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.",No
30095,"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.",Yes
30096,"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.",Yes
30097,"We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.",Yes
30098,"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.",Yes
30099,They're on the front lines.,No
30100,They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,No
30101,"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",No
30103,"Well, I have to respond.",No
30105,"The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.",No
30106,"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.",No
30107,"Under your direction, to a large extent.",No
30108,"But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.",Yes
30109,They were choking on the sanctions.,No
30110,"And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.",No
30111,"But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?",No
30112,"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.",No
30114,But I have common sense.,No
30115,"And I said, well, I'll tell you.",No
30116,I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,No
30118,"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",Yes
30119,"Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.",Yes
30120,"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.",Yes
30121,And I was very strong.,No
30122,And I said it numerous times.,No
30123,"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.",Yes
30124,And I think that's great.,No
30125,And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,Yes
30126,It's a lot of money to protect other people.,No
30127,But I'm all for NATO.,No
30128,"But I said they have to focus on terror, also.",No
30129,And they're going to do that.,No
30130,And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,No
30131,"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.",No
30132,"And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.",Yes
30133,"Not only that, you named the day.",No
30135,"They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.",No
30140,"When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.",No
30141,It should have never happened.,No
30142,"Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.",No
30143,"But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.",No
30144,Now it's in over 30 countries.,Yes
30145,And you're going to stop them?,No
30150,I did not support the war in Iraq.,Yes
30152,"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.",No
30154,Just -- would you like to hear...,No
30157,I was against the war in Iraq.,Yes
30158,Just so you put it out.,No
30160,The record does not show that.,Yes
30162,The record shows that I'm right.,Yes
30163,"When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?",No
30165,I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.,No
30166,We talked about the economy is more important.,No
30167,"I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.",No
30168,I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.,No
30169,"And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.",Yes
30171,And when he -- excuse me.,No
30172,And that was before the war started.,No
30173,"Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.",No
30174,I was against the war.,Yes
30175,"He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.",Yes
30176,"And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.",No
30177,But nobody called Sean Hannity.,Yes
30178,"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.",No
30180,But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,Yes
30181,"And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.",Yes
30182,"But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.",No
30183,He and I used to have arguments about the war.,No
30184,"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.",No
30185,It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,No
30186,And that's exactly what it's done.,No
30190,You didn't hear what I said.,No
30192,"Well, I have much better judgment than she does.",No
30193,There's no question about that.,No
30194,"I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?",No
30196,"I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.",Yes
30197,I have a winning temperament.,No
30198,I know how to win.,No
30199,She does not have a...,No
30202,"The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.",No
30203,"I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.",No
30207,"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",No
30208,"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.",Yes
30209,And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,No
30210,"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",Yes
30211,"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.",Yes
30212,They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,Yes
30213,They had built covert facilities.,Yes
30214,They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,No
30215,And we had sanctioned them.,Yes
30216,"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",Yes
30217,So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,Yes
30218,And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,No
30219,"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.",Yes
30222,That's working with other nations.,No
30223,"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",No
30224,"He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.",Yes
30226,That would not start a war.,No
30227,"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.",No
30229,"No, they were taunting us.",No
30230,... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.,No
30231,"He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",Yes
30232,"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",No
30233,"He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...",Yes
30235,"... have a good time, folks.",No
30237,"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.",No
30238,That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,No
30239,And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,No
30240,"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",No
30241,"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.",No
30243,"It's a good one, though.",No
30244,It well describes the problem.,No
30246,It's not an accurate one at all.,No
30247,It's not an accurate one.,No
30248,So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.,No
30249,I agree with her on one thing.,No
30250,"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.",No
30251,Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,No
30252,"Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.",No
30253,They do not pay us.,Yes
30254,"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.",Yes
30255,That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.,No
30256,"I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.",No
30257,"All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.",No
30258,"We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...",Yes
30260,"Well, wait, but it's very important.",No
30261,"All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.",No
30262,We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,Yes
30263,They have to help us out.,No
30265,"As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.",No
30266,It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,No
30271,"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.",No
30272,But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.,Yes
30273,We have not been updating from the new standpoint.,Yes
30274,I looked the other night.,No
30275,"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.",No
30276,We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,No
30277,"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.",No
30278,But I would certainly not do first strike.,No
30279,"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.",No
30280,"At the same time, we have to be prepared.",No
30281,I can't take anything off the table.,No
30282,"Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",No
30283,China should solve that problem for us.,No
30284,China should go into North Korea.,No
30285,China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,No
30286,"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.",Yes
30287,Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.,Yes
30288,Iran has power over North Korea.,No
30289,"And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",No
30290,And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,No
30291,"And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?",No
30292,Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,No
30293,"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.",Yes
30294,Nobody's ever seen that before.,No
30295,That turned out to be wrong.,No
30296,"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.",Yes
30297,It certainly looks that way.,No
30298,"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",No
30299,This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,No
30300,The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,No
30301,"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",No
30303,And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,No
30304,I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.,No
30305,"Believe me, he's not a happy camper.",No
30308,"Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.",No
30309,Words matter when you run for president.,No
30310,And they really matter when you are president.,No
30311,And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,No
30312,It is essential that America's word be good.,No
30313,And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.,No
30314,I've talked with a number of them.,No
30315,"But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.",No
30316,It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,No
30317,There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,No
30318,"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.",No
30319,And Donald never tells you what he would do.,No
30320,Would he have started a war?,No
30321,Would he have bombed Iran?,No
30322,"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",Yes
30323,But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,No
30324,"He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.",No
30325,So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,No
30326,"People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",No
30327,Can they rely on us?,No
30328,Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,No
30329,That's what I intend to do.,No
30330,"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.",No
30331,We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...,No
30333,... to be given any opportunities at all.,No
30335,"Lester, one thing I'd like to say.",No
30338,I will go very quickly.,No
30339,"But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.",No
30340,"Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.",Yes
30342,And it's a big problem.,No
30343,"And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.",Yes
30344,We cannot be the policemen of the world.,No
30345,We cannot protect countries all over the world...,No
30347,... where they're not paying us what we need.,No
30349,"And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.",No
30351,We need a lot of things.,No
30352,But you have to have some basic ability.,No
30353,"And sadly, she doesn't have that.",No
30354,"All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.",No
30355,But they weren't taken care of.,No
30356,"And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.",No
30361,She doesn't have the look.,No
30362,She doesn't have the stamina.,No
30363,I said she doesn't have the stamina.,Yes
30364,And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,No
30365,"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.",No
30367,You have -- wait a minute.,No
30369,You asked me a question.,No
30370,Did you ask me a question?,No
30371,You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,No
30372,"You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.",No
30373,"I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?",No
30374,"And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?",No
30375,All you have to do is speak to them.,No
30377,"You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.",No
30381,The world -- let me tell you.,No
30383,"Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.",No
30384,"We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.",No
30386,"But it's bad, bad experience.",No
30387,"Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.",Yes
30389,"She's got experience, but it's bad experience.",No
30390,And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,No
30396,"You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.",No
30397,"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...",Yes
30399,.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.,No
30401,And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,No
30402,"He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.",No
30403,"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy.""",Yes
30404,"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina.",Yes
30405,"Donald, she has a name.",No
30406,Where did you find this?,No
30407,Where did you find this?,No
30408,Her name is Alicia Machado.,No
30409,Where did you find this?,No
30410,"And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...",No
30412,... she's going to vote this November.,No
30414,Let me just tell you...,No
30417,"You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.",No
30418,Some of it's said in entertainment.,No
30419,"Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.",No
30420,But you want to know the truth?,No
30421,I was going to say something...,No
30423,"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it.",No
30424,I just can't do it.,No
30427,"But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.",Yes
30430,"And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.",No
30431,And I don't deserve that.,No
30432,But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.,No
30433,It's hundreds of millions of ads.,No
30434,"And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...",No
30436,"... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.",Yes
30441,"Well, I support our democracy.",No
30442,"And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.",No
30443,But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.,No
30444,"And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.",No
30445,It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.,No
30446,"So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.",No
30460,I want to make America great again.,No
30461,I'm going to be able to do it.,No
30462,I don't believe Hillary will.,No
30463,"The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.",No
31839,"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.",No
31840,And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.,No
31841,"And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.",No
31842,"We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.",No
31843,I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.,No
31844,"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.",No
31845,"If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.",No
31846,So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.,No
31847,"Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.",No
31848,"I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.",No
31849,"I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.",No
31852,"Well, I actually agree with that.",No
31853,I agree with everything she said.,No
31854,I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.,No
31855,This is a great country.,No
31856,This is a great land.,No
31857,I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.,No
31858,"I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.",No
31859,And my whole concept was to make America great again.,No
31860,"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",Yes
31861,"When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.",Yes
31862,"Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.",Yes
31863,"In other words, trading with other countries.",No
31864,We had an $800 billion deficit.,Yes
31867,You say who's making these deals?,No
31868,We're going the make great deals.,No
31869,We're going to have a strong border.,No
31870,We're going to bring back law and order.,No
31871,"Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.",Yes
31872,And this is happening on a weekly basis.,No
31873,We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.,No
31874,"At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.",No
31876,"But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.",No
31877,It's called make America great again.,No
31886,"No, I didn't say that at all.",No
31887,I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.,No
31888,I'm not proud of it.,No
31889,I apologize to my family.,No
31890,I apologize to the American people.,No
31891,Certainly I'm not proud of it.,No
31892,But this is locker room talk.,No
31893,"You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.",Yes
31894,"We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.",No
31895,And they look and they see.,No
31896,"Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?",No
31897,And they look at our country and they see what's going on.,No
31898,"Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.",No
31900,"But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.",No
31901,I will knock the hell out of ISIS.,No
31902,We're going to defeat ISIS.,No
31903,ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.,No
31904,"And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.",No
31906,And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.,No
31908,I have great respect for women.,No
31909,Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,No
31911,"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.",No
31912,And I was embarrassed by it.,No
31913,But I have tremendous respect for women.,No
31915,And women have respect for me.,No
31916,"And I will tell you: No, I have not.",No
31917,And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.,No
31918,"We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.",No
31919,"People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.",No
31920,We're going to make America safe again.,No
31921,"We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.",No
31922,"And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.",No
31924,"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.",Yes
31926,And that's what I want to talk about.,No
31928,"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.",No
31929,"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.",No
31931,I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,Yes
31932,And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,Yes
31933,"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.",No
31934,And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,No
31935,But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,No
31936,Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,No
31937,We have seen him insult women.,Yes
31938,"We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.",Yes
31939,We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,Yes
31940,"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.",Yes
31941,"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.",No
31942,"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.",Yes
31943,So this is who Donald Trump is.,No
31944,"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.",No
31945,"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",No
31946,"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",No
31947,And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,No
31949,Am I allowed to respond to that?,No
31954,"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.",No
31955,"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.",Yes
31956,"I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.",No
31957,I'm going to help the African-Americans.,No
31958,"I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.",No
31959,I am going to help the inner cities.,No
31960,She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.,No
31961,"She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.",No
31962,We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.,Yes
31963,She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...,No
31965,"So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?",No
31976,"It was locker room talk, as I told you.",No
31977,That was locker room talk.,No
31978,I'm not proud of it.,No
31979,"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",No
31980,"And certainly, I'm not proud of it.",No
31981,But that was something that happened.,No
31982,"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",No
31983,"Mine are words, and his was action.",No
31984,His was what he's done to women.,No
31985,There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.,No
31986,"So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.",No
31987,Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,Yes
31988,Four of them here tonight.,No
31989,"One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.",No
31990,"Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.",Yes
31991,"Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.",No
31992,So don't tell me about words.,No
31993,I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,No
31994,But it is things that people say.,No
31995,"But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.",Yes
31996,"He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.",Yes
31997,"Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.",No
31998,"And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.",No
32002,"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",No
32003,He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,No
32004,"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",No
32005,"When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.",No
32006,"(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.",No
32007,But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.,No
32008,"He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.",Yes
32009,And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,Yes
32010,"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican.""",Yes
32011,He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.,Yes
32012,And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.,Yes
32013,"He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.",No
32014,"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.",No
32015,So you really owe him an apology.,No
32016,"You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.",Yes
32017,"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.",No
32019,I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.,No
32020,"And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.",No
32021,"So, you talk about friend?",No
32022,"Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.",No
32023,"And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.",No
32024,And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,No
32025,"But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.",Yes
32026,And I'll tell you what.,No
32027,"I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.",No
32028,"But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.",No
32029,"There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.",No
32030,"When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.",No
32031,"In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.",No
32032,"There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.",Yes
32033,"So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?",No
32034,People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.,No
32036,"And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",No
32040,"... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.",Yes
32045,I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.,No
32046,I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.,No
32047,"So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.",No
32048,We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.,No
32049,"Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.",Yes
32050,Because you'd be in jail.,No
32061,"Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.",No
32074,And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.,No
32076,She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.,No
32078,I'm watching Hillary go over facts.,No
32079,"And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.",No
32080,"You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?",No
32082,"She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.",Yes
32083,"Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.",No
32084,"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.",Yes
32085,"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.",Yes
32088,She got it from the United States Congress.,Yes
32089,"And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.",No
32090,"Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.",Yes
32091,"But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.",No
32092,What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.,Yes
32099,"If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",Yes
32102,"Look, it's just not true.",No
32103,"And so please, go to...",No
32104,"Oh, you didn't delete them?",No
32106,"It was personal e-mails, not official.",Yes
32109,"Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...",Yes
32111,"What about the other 15,000?",No
32114,"Yes, that's true, I didn't.",No
32115,Because you have nothing to say.,No
32116,"I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.",No
32119,"I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.",Yes
32120,But let's at least focus...,No
32124,... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,No
32125,Let's get to their questions.,No
32129,"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?",No
32135,And it hasn't been finished at all.,No
32137,It's nice to -- one on three.,No
32147,"If he wants to start, he can start.",No
32149,"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.",No
32153,"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.",No
32154,"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",No
32155,Premiums have gotten too high.,Yes
32156,"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.",Yes
32157,"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",Yes
32158,But that in and of itself was a good thing.,No
32159,"I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.",No
32160,"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.",Yes
32161,"Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.",Yes
32162,"Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.",No
32163,"Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.",Yes
32164,"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.",Yes
32165,So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,No
32166,But we've got to get costs down.,No
32167,We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,No
32168,"But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.",Yes
32169,And then we would have to start all over again.,No
32170,"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.",Yes
32171,That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,Yes
32173,"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.",No
32175,"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.",No
32179,It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,Yes
32180,Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,Yes
32182,"In '17, it implodes by itself.",Yes
32183,"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.",No
32184,We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,Yes
32186,"It's very bad, very bad health insurance.",No
32188,"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.",No
32189,It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,No
32190,"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.",No
32191,"We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.",Yes
32193,You will have the finest health care plan there is.,No
32194,"She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.",Yes
32195,"And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.",Yes
32196,It's catastrophic in certain ways.,No
32197,"But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.",Yes
32198,Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.,Yes
32199,Obamacare was the first step.,No
32200,Obamacare is a total disaster.,No
32201,"And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.",Yes
32203,"It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.",No
32207,"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.",No
32209,"Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.",No
32210,But we have an employer-based system.,No
32211,That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.,Yes
32212,"And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.",Yes
32213,"Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.",No
32214,That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.,Yes
32215,"And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.",Yes
32216,"So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...",No
32218,"... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...",No
32220,... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.,No
32221,"So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.",No
32222,That's not going to work.,No
32234,We're going to be able to.,No
32235,You're going to have plans...,No
32237,"Well, I'll tell you what it means.",No
32238,"You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.",No
32239,Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...,No
32241,"President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.",No
32242,"President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.",Yes
32243,"You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.",Yes
32244,"President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.",Yes
32245,"The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.",Yes
32246,"But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.",No
32247,"And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.",No
32248,We're going to block grant into the states.,No
32249,We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...,No
32251,... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.,No
32258,"Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.",No
32259,But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.,No
32260,"I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.",No
32261,And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.,No
32262,"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.",No
32263,"As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.",Yes
32265,They'll never be the same.,No
32266,Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.,No
32267,"And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.",No
32268,"If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.",No
32271,Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.,Yes
32272,And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.,No
32273,"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism.""",No
32274,"Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.",No
32275,She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.,No
32276,But the name is there.,No
32278,"And before you solve it, you have to say the name.",No
32280,"Well, thank you for asking your question.",No
32281,"And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.",Yes
32282,"And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.",Yes
32283,I want to say just a couple of things.,No
32284,"First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.",Yes
32285,And we've had many successful Muslims.,No
32286,We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.,No
32287,"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.",No
32289,That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,No
32290,It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,No
32291,We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,No
32292,I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,No
32293,"I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.",No
32294,"It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.",No
32295,"Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?",No
32296,"And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.",No
32297,We are not at war with Islam.,Yes
32298,And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,No
32299,So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.,No
32306,"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.",Yes
32308,So he would have been alive today.,No
32309,The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,No
32310,Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.,No
32317,Why don't you interrupt her?,No
32320,We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,Yes
32321,And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,Yes
32322,"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",Yes
32323,This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,No
32324,We have enough problems in this country.,No
32325,I believe in building safe zones.,No
32326,"I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.",No
32327,"But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.",Yes
32328,We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.,No
32333,"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",No
32334,"But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.",No
32335,"There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.",No
32336,And we need to do our part.,No
32337,We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,No
32338,"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.",No
32339,"But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.",Yes
32340,How do you do that?,No
32341,We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,No
32342,How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,No
32343,Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,No
32344,And how do we expect to be able to implement those?,No
32345,So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,No
32346,"And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.",Yes
32347,"And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.",Yes
32348,We have it on tape.,No
32349,The entire press corps has looked at it.,No
32350,"It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.",Yes
32353,That has not been debunked.,Yes
32354,... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.,No
32355,I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.,Yes
32357,And you voted for it.,Yes
32359,"Well, I just want to say...",No
32363,She just went about 25 seconds over her time.,No
32365,"Could I just respond to this, please?",No
32367,"Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.",Yes
32368,"When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.",Yes
32369,"In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.",Yes
32370,And they don't want them.,No
32371,"And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.",Yes
32372,"Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.",No
32373,They're murderers and some very bad people.,Yes
32374,"And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.",Yes
32375,We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.,Yes
32377,And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.,No
32379,They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.,Yes
32380,"The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.",Yes
32382,She wants amnesty for everybody.,Yes
32385,It's a horrible thing she's doing.,No
32386,"She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.",No
32387,That I can tell you.,No
32396,"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln.""",No
32397,It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.,No
32398,"It was principled, and it was strategic.",No
32399,And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.,No
32400,"And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.",No
32401,That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.,No
32402,"But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.",Yes
32403,"And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.",Yes
32404,"We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.",Yes
32405,"And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.",No
32406,They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.,No
32407,"Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.",Yes
32409,And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...,No
32412,... with the Russians and other foreign powers.,No
32414,"Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.",No
32415,"Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.",No
32416,"Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.",Yes
32418,"Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.",Yes
32419,That's one that I haven't...,No
32421,"OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.",No
32423,That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.,No
32424,"That's a big, big difference.",No
32425,We're talking about some difference.,No
32426,"But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.",Yes
32427,"I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.",No
32428,But I don't know Putin.,Yes
32429,"But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.",Yes
32430,Maybe there is no hacking.,No
32431,But they always blame Russia.,No
32432,And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.,No
32433,I know nothing about Russia.,No
32434,"I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.",No
32436,I have no businesses there.,Yes
32437,I have no loans from Russia.,Yes
32438,"I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.",Yes
32439,"One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.",No
32440,But I have no loans with Russia.,Yes
32441,"You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.",No
32442,"Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.",No
32443,"As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.",Yes
32444,Many of her friends took bigger deductions.,Yes
32445,Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.,Yes
32446,"Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.",Yes
32447,Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.,Yes
32448,I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,Yes
32449,"But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.",No
32450,I'll be very proud to.,No
32459,"Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.",No
32460,"One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.",No
32461,"And she could have done this years ago, by the way.",No
32462,She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.,No
32463,She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.,Yes
32464,"Well, why didn't she change it?",No
32465,Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?,No
32466,The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.,No
32468,"You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.",No
32469,"But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.",Yes
32470,But -- and I say that about a lot of things.,No
32471,"You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.",No
32472,I wish you would have done this.,No
32473,But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.,No
32475,And she never will change.,No
32477,We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.,Yes
32478,"I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.",Yes
32479,We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.,No
32480,But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.,Yes
32481,We're cutting taxes for the middle class.,No
32482,"And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.",No
32483,"And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.",Yes
32484,You can look at me.,No
32485,She's raising your taxes really high.,No
32486,And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.,No
32487,But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.,Yes
32488,That in itself is a big difference.,No
32489,We are going to be thriving again.,No
32490,We have no growth in this country.,Yes
32492,"If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.",No
32493,We're down at 1 percent.,Yes
32494,"And that's, like, no growth.",No
32495,"And we're going lower, in my opinion.",No
32496,"And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.",Yes
32497,And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.,No
32498,And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.,No
32499,But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.,Yes
32502,"Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.",Yes
32503,"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.",No
32504,And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.,Yes
32505,But I'll tell you what he's going to do.,No
32506,"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.",Yes
32507,"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.",No
32508,"And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.",Yes
32509,"Now, here's what I want to do.",No
32510,"I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.",Yes
32511,And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,No
32512,"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.",Yes
32513,"I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.",Yes
32514,I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,No
32515,It's called the Buffett rule.,No
32516,"Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.",Yes
32517,I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,No
32518,"We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.",No
32519,I want to invest in hard-working families.,No
32520,"And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.",Yes
32521,And we need to reverse that.,No
32522,"People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.",Yes
32524,"And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.",No
32536,"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.",Yes
32537,I know many of her donors.,No
32538,Her donors took massive tax write-offs.,Yes
32540,"A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.",No
32541,"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.",No
32543,"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.",No
32544,"Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.",Yes
32545,"But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.",No
32546,Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,No
32547,"But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.",Yes
32549,And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,Yes
32550,"Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.",No
32551,So we won't make them famous.,No
32553,"No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.",No
32554,"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.",No
32556,"You know, she's given it to us.",No
32557,"Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.",No
32558,I say it all the time.,No
32559,She talks about health care.,No
32560,Why didn't she do something about it?,No
32562,Why didn't she do something about it?,No
32563,She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,No
32564,"With her, it's all talk and no action.",No
32566,"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.",No
32567,She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,No
32568,"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.",No
32569,"I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.",Yes
32570,"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.",Yes
32574,"Well, here we go again.",No
32575,"I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.",Yes
32576,But that's not the point here.,No
32577,Why didn't you do it?,No
32578,Why didn't you do it?,No
32580,Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,No
32582,I will be the president and we will get it done.,No
32584,"You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",No
32585,"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",No
32586,But you were not an effective senator.,No
32589,"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.",No
32590,"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that.""",No
32591,So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,No
32592,I'm very glad to do so.,No
32593,"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.",Yes
32594,Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,Yes
32595,"After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.",No
32596,"Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.",Yes
32597,"When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.",Yes
32598,Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,Yes
32599,I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,Yes
32600,"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",No
32602,"I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.",No
32606,She said a lot of things that were false.,No
32607,"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",No
32611,Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,No
32621,"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.",No
32622,"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",Yes
32623,And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,Yes
32624,Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,Yes
32625,They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,Yes
32626,"So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.",Yes
32627,"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",No
32628,And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,No
32629,But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,No
32630,"Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.",Yes
32631,"And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.",No
32632,I've stood up to Russia.,No
32633,"I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.",No
32634,"I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.",No
32635,And I did as secretary of state.,Yes
32636,That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,Yes
32637,It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,Yes
32638,So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,No
32639,"But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",No
32642,"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...",No
32645,"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...",No
32647,But you were in contact -- excuse me.,No
32649,"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.",No
32650,"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.",No
32651,I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,No
32652,Obama draws the line in the sand.,No
32653,It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,No
32654,"Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.",No
32655,"But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.",No
32657,Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,No
32658,Russia is new in terms of nuclear.,No
32661,We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.,No
32663,"Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.",Yes
32664,She talks in favor of the rebels.,Yes
32665,She doesn't even know who the rebels are.,No
32666,"You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.",No
32667,And you know what happens?,No
32668,They end up being worse than the people.,No
32669,Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,No
32672,"And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.",Yes
32673,I'm sure you probably have heard that.,No
32675,"Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.",No
32676,"But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.",No
32677,We sign a peace treaty.,No
32679,"Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",Yes
32680,But look at that deal.,No
32681,Iran now and Russia are now against us.,Yes
32682,So she wants to fight.,No
32683,She wants to fight for rebels.,Yes
32685,You don't even know who the rebels are.,No
32688,And one thing I have to say.,No
32690,"I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.",Yes
32692,And Iran is killing ISIS.,Yes
32693,And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.,No
32701,"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.",No
32704,I think you have to knock out ISIS.,No
32705,"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.",Yes
32706,We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,No
32707,But Syria is no longer Syria.,No
32708,"Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.",No
32709,I believe we have to get ISIS.,No
32710,We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.,No
32711,She had a chance to do something with Syria.,No
32713,And that was the line.,No
32716,"I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.",No
32718,I think that it basically has fallen.,No
32721,Let me tell you something.,No
32722,You take a look at Mosul.,No
32723,"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",No
32724,They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,Yes
32725,"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",Yes
32726,"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",Yes
32727,Why can't they do it quietly?,No
32728,"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",No
32730,"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",No
32731,How stupid is our country?,No
32734,I can't think of any.,No
32735,I can't think of any.,No
32736,And I'm pretty good at it.,No
32738,And we have General Flynn.,No
32739,"And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.",Yes
32740,I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,No
32741,We talk about it all the time.,No
32742,"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",No
32743,How -- why would these people stay there?,No
32746,"... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.",Yes
32747,Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.,No
32749,"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",Yes
32750,"Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.",Yes
32751,All I say is this.,No
32752,"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.",No
32760,I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,No
32761,I think that would be a very serious mistake.,No
32762,"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",No
32763,I don't think that is a smart strategy.,No
32764,"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...",Yes
32766,"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...",No
32768,I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,No
32769,I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,No
32770,"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",Yes
32772,"There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.",No
32773,And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,No
32774,I would go after Baghdadi.,No
32775,"I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.",No
32776,So I think that could help.,No
32777,I would also consider arming the Kurds.,No
32778,"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.",Yes
32779,"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",No
32783,"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.",No
32784,"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.",No
32786,It's really -- it's really very interesting.,No
32792,"I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.",Yes
32793,I will be a president for all of our people.,No
32794,And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.,No
32795,"Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.",Yes
32797,It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.,Yes
32802,"And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.",Yes
32803,She called it the gold standard.,Yes
32804,"And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.",Yes
32805,They actually said that she lied.,Yes
32808,But she's lied about a lot of things.,Yes
32809,"I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.",No
32810,Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.,No
32811,She's been talking about it for years.,No
32812,"As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.",No
32813,She doesn't get it done.,No
32814,"Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.",No
32816,"They talk, they don't get it done.",No
32817,You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.,Yes
32818,African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.,Yes
32819,The education is a disaster.,No
32821,"I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?",No
32822,It can't get any worse.,No
32823,And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.,Yes
32824,Nothing's going to ever happen.,No
32825,"Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.",No
32826,It's just going to be talk.,No
32827,"And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.",No
32828,She's not doing any me favors.,No
32829,"But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.",No
32831,"But I will tell you, she's all talk.",No
32833,All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,No
32834,Take a look at upstate New York.,No
32837,It turned out to be a disaster.,No
32839,"Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.",Yes
32840,"Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.",No
32841,"You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.",No
32842,"And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.",No
32844,"You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.",No
32845,"I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.",Yes
32846,I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.,No
32847,"So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.",No
32848,"And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.",No
32849,"They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.",No
32850,She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.,No
32851,He's 10 years old now.,No
32852,This is the only one country he's ever known.,No
32853,"And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?",No
32854,"You know, children listen to what is being said.",No
32855,"To go back to the very, very first question.",No
32856,"And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.",Yes
32858,"A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.",No
32859,A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.,No
32860,"So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.",No
32862,"Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.",No
32863,"If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.",No
32865,I want to be the best president I can be for every American.,No
32872,"Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.",No
32873,"It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.",No
32874,"And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.",Yes
32875,And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,No
32876,"We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.",No
32877,And he is supporting me 100 percent.,Yes
32879,Because we talked about what we wanted to do.,No
32880,"We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...",No
32882,... but we believed that we could make the country better.,No
32883,And I was proud of that.,No
32885,We have a divided nation.,No
32886,We have a very divided nation.,No
32889,"You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.",No
32890,"We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.",Yes
32891,"We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.",No
32892,"And when she said deplorables, she meant it.",No
32893,"And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.",No
32895,She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.,No
32896,"And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.",No
32902,"No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.",Yes
32903,It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.,No
32905,"By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.",No
32906,She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?,No
32908,"She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...",Yes
32910,"... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.",No
32911,"Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.",No
32912,But she said she'll be awake.,No
32913,"Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.",No
32915,Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.,Yes
32916,"And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.",Yes
32917,"So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.",No
32918,"Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.",No
32919,"I mean, you can like it or not like it.",No
32920,"I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.",No
32921,It's a very effective way of communication.,No
32922,"So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.",No
32923,"I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.",No
32926,I'm shocked to hear that.,No
32928,"Well, it's not only my opinion.",No
32929,"It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.",Yes
32930,"But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.",Yes
32932,African-American incomes went up 33 percent.,Yes
32933,"And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.",No
32935,And I have worked and I admire President Obama.,No
32936,He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,Yes
32937,That was a terrible time for our country.,No
32939,Nine million people lost their jobs.,Yes
32941,Five million homes were lost.,Yes
32943,And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,Yes
32944,We are back on the right track.,No
32945,He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.,Yes
32950,It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.,Yes
32962,This is one of the most important issues in this election.,No
32963,"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.",No
32964,Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.,No
32965,"And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.",No
32966,Donald doesn't agree with that.,Yes
32967,"I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.",Yes
32968,"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.",No
32969,"Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.",No
32970,And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.,No
32971,I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.,No
32972,I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.,No
32973,I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.,No
32974,So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.,No
32975,"And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.",Yes
32976,I think that was a dereliction of duty.,No
32977,"I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.",No
32982,"Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.",No
32983,And we have a vacancy.,No
32984,I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,No
32985,"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.",No
32986,But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.,No
32987,And I think that this is so important.,No
32988,"Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.",No
32989,"They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.",No
32991,"Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.",No
32992,"So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.",Yes
32993,What I ask is this.,No
32994,"So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.",Yes
32996,"We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.",Yes
32997,"I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.",No
32998,She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,Yes
32999,"Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?",No
33000,"It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.",No
33001,Why aren't you putting some money in?,No
33002,You have a lot of it.,No
33003,You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.,No
33004,"Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.",Yes
33005,So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?,No
33011,The question was about the Supreme Court.,No
33012,"And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.",No
33013,"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.",No
33016,We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,No
33022,"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.",Yes
33024,"The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.",No
33025,And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.,Yes
33026,We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,Yes
33027,"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.",No
33028,But we need much more than wind and solar.,No
33029,And you look at our miners.,No
33030,Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.,Yes
33031,There is a thing called clean coal.,No
33032,"Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.",Yes
33033,Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.,No
33034,"We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.",Yes
33036,Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.,Yes
33037,I will bring our energy companies back.,No
33038,They'll be able to compete.,No
33040,They'll pay off our national debt.,No
33041,"They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.",No
33042,But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,Yes
33043,We have to bring back our workers.,No
33044,"You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.",Yes
33045,We have to guard our energy companies.,No
33046,We have to make it possible.,No
33047,The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.,Yes
33048,"And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.",No
33054,"And actually -- well, that was very interesting.",No
33055,"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.",Yes
33056,That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,Yes
33057,"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",Yes
33058,We are not dependent upon the Middle East.,No
33059,But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.,Yes
33060,So the price of oil has been way down.,Yes
33061,"And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?",No
33062,"We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.",Yes
33063,And I think that's an important transition.,No
33064,We've got to remain energy-independent.,No
33065,It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,No
33066,We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.,No
33067,"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.",Yes
33068,"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.",No
33069,But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.,No
33070,"That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.",No
33071,A lot of them lost their lives.,No
33072,"They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.",No
33073,I don't want to walk away from them.,No
33074,So we've got to do something for them.,No
33076,But the price of coal is down worldwide.,Yes
33077,So we have to look at this comprehensively.,No
33079,And that's exactly what I have proposed.,Yes
33080,I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,No
33090,"Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.",No
33091,"Look, I respect his children.",No
33092,"His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.",No
33093,"I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.",No
33094,And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.,No
33095,"So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.",No
33096,"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.",No
33097,"We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.",No
33098,It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,No
33099,"And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.",No
33100,"And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.",No
33101,And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.,No
33103,"Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.",No
33104,"I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.",No
33105,"And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.",No
33106,So I consider that a compliment.,No
33107,I will say this about Hillary.,No
33111,I tell it like it is.,No
33113,I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.,No
33114,I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.,No
33115,"But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.",No
33116,And I consider that to be a very good trait.,No
33143,"Thank you very much, Chris.",No
33144,And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.,No
33145,"You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?",No
33146,What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?,No
33147,What kind of rights will Americans have?,No
33148,"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.",No
33149,"For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.",Yes
33150,I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,No
33151,"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.",No
33152,"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.",No
33153,And I look forward to having that opportunity.,No
33154,I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.,No
33155,That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,No
33156,"The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.",No
33161,"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.",No
33162,The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,No
33163,"Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.",No
33164,"Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.",Yes
33165,And she was forced to apologize.,Yes
33167,"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.",No
33168,"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.",No
33169,"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.",No
33170,"But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.",No
33171,I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.,No
33172,They will have a conservative bent.,No
33173,They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,No
33174,"They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.",No
33175,They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,No
33176,"And I believe that's very, very important.",No
33177,I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.,No
33178,"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.",No
33179,And those are the people that I will appoint.,No
33188,"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.",No
33189,I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,No
33190,I represented upstate New York.,No
33191,I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,No
33192,It goes back to the founding of our country.,Yes
33193,But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,No
33194,"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.",No
33195,"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.",Yes
33196,"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.",No
33197,There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,No
33198,You mentioned the Heller decision.,No
33199,"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",Yes
33200,"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",Yes
33201,So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.,No
33207,"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.",No
33216,"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.",Yes
33217,"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",No
33218,"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.",No
33219,"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",Yes
33220,The gun lobby's on his side.,Yes
33221,They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,Yes
33222,"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",No
33223,"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",Yes
33227,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",No
33228,"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.",Yes
33229,"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.",Yes
33230,I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,Yes
33231,"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.",No
33232,And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,Yes
33233,So I'm very honored by all of that.,No
33234,We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,No
33235,"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",No
33240,"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",No
33243,"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",No
33246,"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",No
33247,"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.",No
33248,"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",No
33250,"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.",Yes
33251,"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",No
33252,It is about what's happening right now in America.,No
33253,"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.",Yes
33254,Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,Yes
33255,He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,Yes
33256,I will defend Planned Parenthood.,No
33257,"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",No
33265,Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,Yes
33266,"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.",No
33267,"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",No
33268,"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.",No
33269,I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,No
33270,So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.,No
33273,"Well, I think it's terrible.",No
33274,"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",Yes
33275,"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.",No
33276,"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.",No
33278,"Well, that is not what happens in these cases.",No
33279,And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,No
33280,"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.",No
33281,This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,No
33282,And I do not believe the government should be making it.,No
33283,"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.",No
33284,"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.",Yes
33285,"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",No
33286,And I will stand up for that right.,No
33289,"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",No
33302,"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.",Yes
33304,"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.",Yes
33305,You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,No
33307,Drugs are pouring in through the border.,Yes
33308,We have no country if we have no border.,No
33309,Hillary wants to give amnesty.,Yes
33310,She wants to have open borders.,Yes
33311,"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",Yes
33312,First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,Yes
33313,It means their job is tougher.,No
33314,But they know what's going on.,No
33315,They know it better than anybody.,No
33317,They feel we have to have strong borders.,No
33318,I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,No
33319,"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",No
33320,All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,Yes
33321,It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,No
33322,It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,No
33323,We have to have strong borders.,No
33324,We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,No
33325,"We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.",No
33327,We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,No
33328,"Now, I want to build the wall.",No
33330,"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",Yes
33332,We shore up the border.,No
33333,"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.",No
33334,We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,No
33335,"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",No
33336,"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.",No
33340,"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.",No
33341,"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.",No
33343,I don't want to rip families apart.,No
33344,I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,No
33345,I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,No
33346,We have 11 million undocumented people.,Yes
33347,"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.",Yes
33348,He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,Yes
33349,"Now, here's what that means.",No
33350,"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.",No
33351,"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.",No
33352,I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,No
33353,I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,No
33354,I have been for border security for years.,Yes
33355,I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,Yes
33356,And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,Yes
33357,But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,No
33358,"Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.",No
33359,"When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.",Yes
33361,He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,Yes
33362,So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.,No
33363,And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.,No
33368,I think I should respond to that.,No
33369,"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.",No
33371,We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,No
33373,"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.",Yes
33375,Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,Yes
33376,Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,Yes
33377,"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.",No
33378,But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,Yes
33380,We are a country of laws.,No
33381,We either have -- and by the way...,No
33384,"Well -- well, but she said one thing.",No
33386,"I voted for border security, and there are...",Yes
33388,There are some limited places where that was appropriate.,No
33389,There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.,No
33390,"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.",Yes
33391,"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.",No
33392,And Donald knows a lot about this.,No
33393,He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,Yes
33394,"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported.""",Yes
33395,"I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.",Yes
33397,President Obama has moved millions of people out.,Yes
33398,"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.",No
33399,"But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.",Yes
33401,"She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.",Yes
33402,As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.,No
33403,We're a country of laws.,No
33404,We either have a border or we don't.,No
33405,"Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.",No
33407,We have millions of people that did it the right way.,No
33410,"We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.",No
33411,But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.,No
33412,"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.",Yes
33413,"You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.",No
33415,But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,Yes
33417,We will not have open borders.,No
33420,That is a rank mischaracterization.,No
33422,"We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.",No
33423,And this used to be a bipartisan issue.,No
33424,Ronald Reagan was the last president...,No
33427,"... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.",Yes
33435,"Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.",No
33444,"So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?",Yes
33445,Those are the questions we need answered.,No
33446,We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.,Yes
33448,"That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?",Yes
33449,How did we get on to Putin?,No
33454,So just to finish on the borders...,No
33457,People are going to pour into our country.,No
33458,People are going to come in from Syria.,No
33459,"She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.",Yes
33460,They have no idea where they come from.,Yes
33461,"And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.",No
33462,"She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.",No
33463,"So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.",Yes
33464,Now we can talk about Putin.,No
33466,He said nice things about me.,No
33467,"If we got along well, that would be good.",No
33468,"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.",No
33469,He has no respect for her.,No
33470,He has no respect for our president.,No
33471,"And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.",Yes
33475,"... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.",No
33476,"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.",No
33481,It's pretty clear you won't admit...,No
33483,"... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.",Yes
33484,So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,No
33485,We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.,Yes
33486,"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.",Yes
33487,I find that deeply disturbing.,No
33489,And I think it's time you take a stand...,No
33490,"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.",No
33491,I am not quoting myself.,No
33494,"Hillary, you have no idea.",No
33495,... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,No
33496,And our country has no idea.,No
33500,"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.",No
33501,I find that just absolutely...,No
33503,She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,No
33506,Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,No
33509,He's outsmarted her every step of the way.,No
33515,By Russia or anybody else.,No
33518,Of course I -- I don't know Putin.,Yes
33522,This is not my best friend.,No
33523,"But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.",No
33524,"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.",No
33525,"Whether it's Syria, you name it.",No
33527,"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed.",No
33528,"The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.",Yes
33529,"They create warheads, and we can't.",Yes
33530,The Russians can't believe it.,No
33531,She has been outsmarted by Putin.,No
33532,And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,No
33535,They've taken over the Middle East.,No
33536,She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.,No
33539,And she always will be.,No
33540,I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.,Yes
33541,"This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.",No
33544,"... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",Yes
33545,"He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.",Yes
33547,"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.",No
33548,There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.,Yes
33549,"And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.",Yes
33552,"... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.",Yes
33553,"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.",No
33554,We are spending a fortune doing it.,No
33555,They have the bargain of the century.,No
33556,"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.",No
33557,We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.,No
33559,"Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.",Yes
33560,This is just another lie.,No
33561,"Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...",No
33563,You're not going to find a quote from me.,No
33564,"... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.",Yes
33571,The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.,Yes
33572,Donald wants to tear up our alliances.,No
33573,"I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.",No
33574,"I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.",No
33575,That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.,No
33586,"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.",No
33587,"And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.",No
33588,"I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.",No
33589,"I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.",No
33590,"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.",No
33591,I want us to do more to help small business.,No
33592,That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.,No
33593,"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.",No
33594,And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.,No
33595,I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.,No
33596,"That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.",No
33597,"I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.",Yes
33598,"And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.",No
33599,Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.,Yes
33600,So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,No
33601,We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,No
33602,That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,Yes
33603,"By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.",Yes
33605,"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.",Yes
33606,So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,No
33607,The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.,No
33610,"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.",Yes
33611,Her tax plan is a disaster.,No
33612,And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,No
33613,And I'm a big proponent.,No
33614,We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,No
33615,But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.,No
33616,"We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.",Yes
33617,"But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.",No
33618,"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.",No
33621,"She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.",No
33622,Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?,No
33624,"Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.",No
33625,And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.,Yes
33626,"All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.",No
33627,They have to pay up.,No
33628,"We're protecting people, they have to pay up.",No
33629,And I'm a big fan of NATO.,No
33630,But they have to pay up.,No
33631,"She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.",No
33632,"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.",No
33633,"We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.",No
33634,"We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.",Yes
33635,We're up to $20 trillion.,Yes
33636,So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.,No
33637,We're going to have a lot of free trade.,No
33638,"We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.",No
33639,But we have horrible deals.,No
33640,"Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.",Yes
33641,Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.,Yes
33642,"You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.",No
33643,You go upstate New York.,No
33644,Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.,Yes
33645,We're bringing our jobs back.,No
33646,I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.,No
33647,And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.,No
33648,"We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.",No
33649,"And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.",No
33650,We are going to cut taxes massively.,No
33651,We're going to cut business taxes massively.,No
33652,They're going to start hiring people.,No
33653,We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...,No
33655,... that's offshore back into the country.,No
33656,"We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...",No
33658,"... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.",Yes
33659,"Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...",No
33661,"... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.",Yes
33662,"I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.",Yes
33663,I also will not add a penny to the debt.,No
33664,I have costed out what I'm going to do.,No
33665,"He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.",Yes
33666,"Well, he mentioned the debt.",No
33667,We know how to get control of the debt.,No
33668,"When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.",Yes
33669,"When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.",Yes
33670,He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.,Yes
33671,"So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.",No
33672,"So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.",No
33673,That's the kind of approach that will work.,No
33675,"Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.",Yes
33676,It has not worked the way that it has been promised.,Yes
33682,"Well, it's a combination, Chris.",No
33683,"And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.",Yes
33684,I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.,No
33685,I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.,No
33686,I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.,No
33687,He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.,No
33688,But it was a terrible recession.,No
33689,"So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.",No
33690,"So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.",No
33691,That is not going to work.,No
33692,"That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.",Yes
33693,"We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.",Yes
33694,"We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.",No
33701,So I just left some high representatives of India.,No
33702,They're growing at 8 percent.,Yes
33703,China is growing at 7 percent.,Yes
33704,And that for them is a catastrophically low number.,Yes
33705,We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.,Yes
33706,And I think it's going down.,No
33707,"Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.",Yes
33709,"In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?",No
33710,"Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.",No
33711,The report was so bad.,No
33712,"Look, our country is stagnant.",No
33715,"We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.",No
33716,"Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.",Yes
33717,I've visited so many communities.,No
33718,"This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.",No
33719,I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.,No
33720,And they cry when they see what's happened.,No
33721,"I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.",Yes
33722,"Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.",No
33724,That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.,No
33725,Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.,Yes
33727,She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.,No
33729,She did call it the gold standard.,Yes
33730,"And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.",Yes
33733,And that will be as bad as NAFTA.,No
33736,"Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.",No
33737,It didn't meet my test.,No
33738,I've had the same test.,No
33739,"Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?",No
33741,I'll be against it after the election.,No
33742,I'll be against it when I'm president.,No
33743,"There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.",Yes
33744,"He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.",Yes
33746,"And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.",Yes
33747,I have fought against that as a senator.,Yes
33748,I've stood up against it as secretary of state.,Yes
33749,Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.,Yes
33750,"In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.",Yes
33751,"So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.",Yes
33753,That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.,No
33754,"Well, let me just say -- let me just say.",No
33755,We're going to pull the country together.,No
33756,We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.,No
33757,That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.,No
33758,"And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.",No
33761,Let me ask a simple question.,No
33762,She's been doing this for 30 years.,No
33763,"Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?",No
33765,You were very much involved -- excuse me.,No
33767,You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.,No
33769,And you do have experience.,No
33770,"I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.",No
33771,"For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.",No
33773,"The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.",No
33775,"Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.",Yes
33776,How do you miss $6 billion?,No
33777,"You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.",Yes
33780,"If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.",No
33782,"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.",Yes
33783,But I think it's really an important issue.,No
33784,"He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.",No
33785,"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.",No
33786,And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.,Yes
33787,He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.,Yes
33788,"In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.",No
33789,He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.,Yes
33790,"In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.",No
33791,"He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.",No
33793,"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice.""",Yes
33794,"So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.",No
33795,"Well, I think I did a much better job.",No
33796,"I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.",No
33797,I started with a $1 million loan.,No
33799,It's a $1 million loan.,Yes
33800,But I built a phenomenal company.,No
33801,"And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.",No
33802,You would even be proud of it.,No
33803,"And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.",No
33804,Take a look at the migration.,No
33805,Take a look at Libya.,No
33806,Take a look at Iraq.,No
33807,"She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.",No
33808,She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,No
33809,And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.,Yes
33810,And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.,No
33811,She's going to get rid of nobody.,No
33819,"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.",Yes
33820,Those people -- I don't know those people.,No
33821,I have a feeling how they came.,No
33822,I believe it was her campaign that did it.,No
33823,Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?,No
33824,She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.,No
33825,"They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.",Yes
33826,"I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.",No
33827,"And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.",No
33828,I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.,Yes
33829,"These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.",No
33830,And I think it's her campaign.,No
33831,"Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.",Yes
33832,"And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.",No
33833,"And that was now all on tape, started by her.",Yes
33834,"I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.",No
33835,"If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.",No
33836,But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.,Yes
33837,"It was lies, and it was fiction.",No
33840,"At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.",Yes
33841,"And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.",Yes
33842,"Now, what was his response?",No
33843,"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.",Yes
33844,I did not say that.,Yes
33845,I did not say that.,Yes
33846,"In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.",No
33848,I did not say that.,Yes
33850,"He went on to say, ""Look at her.",No
33852,"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice.""",Yes
33853,"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign.",Yes
33854,Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.,No
33855,"He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.",No
33856,So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.,No
33858,"I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.",No
33859,"America is great, because America is good.",No
33860,"And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.",No
33862,Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,No
33867,"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.",Yes
33868,And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.,No
33869,"She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.",No
33870,"But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",Yes
33871,"What happened to the FBI, I don't know.",No
33872,"We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.",Yes
33874,"She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.",Yes
33875,He's going to probably go to jail.,No
33876,This is a four-star general.,No
33877,"And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?",No
33878,"That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.",No
33880,"Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.",No
33881,And it's not just about women.,No
33882,He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.,No
33883,So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.,No
33884,"But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.",Yes
33886,"He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.",Yes
33887,"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured.""",No
33888,"He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.",Yes
33889,So it's not one thing.,No
33890,"This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.",Yes
33891,That is not who America is.,No
33892,"And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.",No
33893,It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.,No
33894,"So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.",Yes
33897,"The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...",No
33899,"... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.",Yes
33907,"Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.",No
33908,The State Department has said that.,Yes
33909,I think that's been proven.,No
33910,"But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.",No
33911,"You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.",No
33912,"But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.",Yes
33913,In partnership with the American Health Association...,No
33915,"... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...",Yes
33917,"Well, it is an open discussion.",No
33921,"Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...",No
33923,I think that it's been very well...,No
33925,There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...,No
33926,It's been very well studied.,No
33930,"... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.",Yes
33934,"Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.",Yes
33935,You talk about women and women's rights?,No
33936,So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,Yes
33937,These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.,Yes
33938,And yet you take their money.,Yes
33939,"So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?",No
33940,Why don't you give back the money?,No
33941,I think it would be a great gesture.,No
33942,Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.,Yes
33943,And you take a look at the people of Haiti.,No
33944,I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.,No
33945,"And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.",No
33946,"And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.",No
33948,"Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.",Yes
33949,I'm very proud of that.,No
33950,We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,Yes
33951,"And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.",Yes
33952,"I mean, who does that?",No
33954,"But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.",Yes
33955,"The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.",No
33956,Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.,Yes
33957,The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.,Yes
33958,"We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.",Yes
33959,And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...,No
33961,... because it's an important part of the American experience.,No
33962,They don't want you to help them anymore.,No
33964,I'd like to mention one thing.,No
33967,"The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.",Yes
33971,What happens -- the money goes to them.,No
33973,"No, it was -- we put up the American flag.",Yes
33975,They put up the American flag.,No
33976,We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.,Yes
33983,"... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.",Yes
33985,"But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.",Yes
33986,"He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.",Yes
33987,You can look at our tax returns.,No
33988,We've got them all out there.,Yes
33989,But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.,Yes
33990,"And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.",No
33991,"You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.",Yes
33992,So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.,Yes
33993,I find that just astonishing.,No
33995,"So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.",Yes
33996,"And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...",Yes
34000,Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.,No
34002,You know what she should have done?,No
34004,"And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...",No
34006,"... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.",Yes
34008,You should have changed the law.,No
34009,"But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.",No
34010,"I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...",No
34012,"But I will tell you, I sat there...",No
34014,"I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.",No
34015,All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.,No
34016,"And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.",No
34018,"If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.",No
34024,I will look at it at the time.,No
34025,I'm not looking at anything now.,No
34026,I'll look at it at the time.,No
34027,What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.,No
34028,"First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.",No
34029,"The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.",No
34031,And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.,No
34032,"But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.",No
34033,I think they're going to see through it.,No
34034,We'll find out on November 8th.,No
34035,But I think they're going to see through it.,No
34037,"If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.",Yes
34038,So let me just give you one other thing.,No
34039,So I talk about the corrupt media.,No
34040,I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.,No
34041,She shouldn't be allowed to run.,No
34042,"It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.",Yes
34043,She should not be allowed to run.,No
34044,"And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...",No
34046,"Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.",No
34050,What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.,No
34051,I'll keep you in suspense.,No
34053,"Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.",No
34054,"You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.",No
34055,The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.,Yes
34056,They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.,Yes
34057,He lost the Iowa caucus.,Yes
34058,He lost the Wisconsin primary.,Yes
34059,He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.,Yes
34060,Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.,Yes
34061,There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.,Yes
34064,This is -- this is a mindset.,No
34065,This is how Donald thinks.,No
34066,"And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.",No
34068,So that is not the way our democracy works.,No
34069,We've been around for 240 years.,No
34070,We've had free and fair elections.,No
34071,We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.,No
34072,And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.,No
34073,"You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...",No
34078,... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.,No
34079,"And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.",No
34080,He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.,No
34081,"And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.",Yes
34082,"I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.",Yes
34083,I think it's a disgrace.,No
34085,I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.,No
34096,"Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.",Yes
34097,But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.,No
34098,"I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.",No
34099,"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.",No
34100,The goal here is to take back Mosul.,No
34101,It's going to be a hard fight.,No
34102,I've got no illusions about that.,No
34103,"And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.",No
34104,I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,No
34105,But we know we've got lots of work to do.,No
34106,"Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.",Yes
34107,"So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.",No
34108,"That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.",No
34109,"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.",No
34110,"And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.",No
34113,"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.",No
34115,"But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.",Yes
34116,Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.,Yes
34117,The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.,Yes
34118,"About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.",No
34119,"Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?",No
34120,We announce we're going after Mosul.,No
34121,"I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?",No
34122,These people have all left.,Yes
34125,"Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.",No
34126,"So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.",Yes
34127,"All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.",No
34128,But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?,No
34129,And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.,No
34130,They want to look good.,No
34131,"He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.",Yes
34132,That's why we have the great migration.,No
34133,But she wanted to look good for the election.,No
34135,"But who's going to get Mosul, really?",No
34137,"But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.",No
34140,Going to be more deaths that they thought.,No
34141,But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.,No
34142,"They say, what do we need this for?",No
34143,So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.,No
34144,"And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.",Yes
34145,"Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.",Yes
34146,So we're now going to take Mosul.,No
34147,And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?,No
34149,"Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.",No
34150,But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.,Yes
34151,"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.",Yes
34152,"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.",No
34154,"The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.",No
34155,"Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.",Yes
34156,I said it was a mistake.,Yes
34157,I've said that years ago.,No
34158,He has consistently denied what is...,Yes
34160,... a very clear fact that...,No
34162,"... before the invasion, he supported it.",Yes
34163,"And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.",No
34165,And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.,Yes
34167,And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.,No
34168,"Now, why does that matter?",No
34169,"Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.",Yes
34170,I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.,Yes
34171,But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.,No
34172,Mosul is a Sunni city.,No
34173,Mosul is on the border of Syria.,No
34174,"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice.",No
34175,We need to go after the leadership.,No
34176,"But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.",No
34177,There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.,Yes
34179,They've been prepared to defend.,No
34180,It's going to be tough fighting.,No
34181,"But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.",No
34182,This is what we have to do.,No
34183,"I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.",No
34184,"You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.",No
34185,"Chris, we don't gain anything.",No
34186,He has all the conspiracy theories...,No
34188,Iran is taking over Iraq.,Yes
34191,Iran is taking over Iraq.,Yes
34193,"This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.",No
34194,If they did it by surprise...,No
34199,We could have gained if they did it by surprise.,No
34201,"... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.",No
34202,"No, you are the one that's unfit.",No
34203,"You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.",Yes
34205,"And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.",No
34207,"And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.",No
34208,"If you think that was good, then you do.",No
34209,"Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.",No
34210,Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.,No
34212,"Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.",No
34214,Which is a big mistake.,No
34215,"... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.",Yes
34229,Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?,No
34231,"OK, so it hasn't fallen.",No
34232,Take a look at it.,No
34235,And they are being slaughtered...,Yes
34241,"Well, Aleppo is a disaster.",No
34243,But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.,No
34244,"I mean, what do you need, a signed document?",No
34245,Take a look at Aleppo.,No
34246,It is so sad when you see what's happened.,No
34247,"And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.",Yes
34248,"And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.",No
34249,He -- he aligned with Russia.,No
34250,"He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.",Yes
34251,We gave them $150 billion back.,Yes
34252,We give them $1.7 billion in cash.,Yes
34254,Bundles of cash as big as this stage.,Yes
34255,We gave them $1.7 billion.,Yes
34256,Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.,Yes
34257,"They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.",Yes
34258,We don't know who the rebels are.,Yes
34259,"We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.",Yes
34260,We don't know who the rebels are.,No
34261,"And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.",No
34262,"But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.",No
34263,"If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.",No
34264,"And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...",Yes
34266,"... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.",Yes
34267,And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.,No
34269,Thanks a lot for doing a great job.,No
34275,"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.",No
34276,I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.,No
34277,This would not be done just on the first day.,No
34278,This would take a lot of negotiation.,No
34279,And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.,No
34280,We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.,Yes
34281,"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.",No
34282,But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.,No
34283,He's made these claims repeatedly.,Yes
34284,"I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.",No
34285,But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.,No
34286,"That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.",No
34287,"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.",No
34288,"That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.",No
34289,"In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.",No
34290,So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.,No
34291,"And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.",No
34293,But I just have to...,No
34295,It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,No
34296,We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,No

34316,"Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.",No
34317,"And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.",Yes
34318,But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.,Yes
34319,And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.,No
34320,I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.,No
34321,"And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.",No
34322,We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.,No
34323,"To do that, we're taking back jobs.",No
34324,"We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.",No

34343,"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great.",No
34344,"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.",No
34345,"You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.",Yes

34350,"I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.",No
34351,"So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.",No
34352,We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.,No

34355,We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.,No
34356,"We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.",No

34358,That's why I want to invest in you.,No

34360,"And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.",No
34361,And we just have a big disagreement about this.,No
34362,It may be because of our experiences.,No
34363,"You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...",No
34364,"Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.",No
34365,I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.,No
34367,"And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.",No

34390,"It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.",No
34391,We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,No
34392,"You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.",No
34393,"If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.",No
34394,But Obamacare has to go.,No
34395,"It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.",Yes
34396,Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.,No
34397,"And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.",No
34398,Bad health care at the most expensive price.,No
34399,We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,No
34402,"Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.",Yes
34403,That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.,No
34404,"My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.",No
34405,But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...,No
34407,"... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.",No
34408,I will not cut benefits.,No
34409,I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.,No
34410,But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.,Yes
34411,That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.,No
34412,"And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.",Yes
34413,The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.,Yes
34414,"So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.",No
34415,What we need to do is go after...,No
34416,Your husband disagrees with you.,No
34417,... the long-term health care drivers.,No
34418,"We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.",No
34419,I have a plan for doing that.,No
34420,And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.,No
34427,"Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.",No
34428,"We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.",No
34429,"You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.",No
34430,And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.,No
34431,I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.,No
